<div class="blockquot"><p><i><span class="gesperrt">SHEWETH</span></i>,</p></div>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>hat by an Act passed in <i>New-York</i> the 19th of <i>November</i>, 1720,
entitled, <i>An Act for Encouragement of the</i> Indian <i>Trade, and rendering
it more beneficial to the Inhabitants of this Province, and for
prohibiting the selling of</i> Indian Goods <i>to the</i> French, all Trade
whatsoever is prohibited in the strictest Manner, and under the severest
Penalties, between the Inhabitants of <i>New-York</i> Government, and the
<i>French</i> of <i>Canada</i>, or any Subjects of the <i>French King</i>, or any
Person whatsoever, for or on the behalf of any such Subjects; and which
Act was to continue in force for three Years.</p>

<p>That the Reasons assigned in the Preamble of this Act, for the passing
thereof, are, For that the <i>French</i> at <i>Canada</i>, by means of <i>Indian</i>
Goods purchased from the Inhabitants of <i>New-York</i>, had not only almost
wholly engrossed the <i>Indian Trade</i> to themselves, but had, in great
measure, withdrawn the Affections of the <i>Five Nations</i> of <i>Indians</i>
from the Inhabitants of <i>New-York</i>, and render'd them wavering in their
Faith and Allegiance to your Majesty; and would, if such Trade was not
prevented, wholly alienate the Minds of the said <i>Indians</i>, which might
prove of dangerous Consequence to the <i>English Interest</i> in <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>That this Act was sent home for your Majesty's royal Consideration, but
your Petitioners do not find that your Majesty ever signified your
Allowance or Disallowance thereof; from whence, and from the Act's being
to continue but three Years, your Petitioners humbly conceive the same
was suffered to lie by probationary, to see whether the said Act, in its
Effects, was really advantageous or prejudicial to the <i>British Trade</i>
and <i>Interest</i> in <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>That your Petitioners have received Advice, That the Government of
<i>New-York</i> either have, or are about passing an Act, to revive and
continue the said Act for prohibiting all Trade between <i>New-York</i> and
<i>Canada</i>.</p>

<p>Upon which Occasion, your Petitioners humbly beg leave to represent to
your Majesty, That the said Act, tho' in the first Intention of it, it
might be well designed, yet, in its Effects, it has proved very
pernicious to the <i>British Trade</i> in general, and to the Interest of
<i>New-York</i> in particular: For, besides the Nations of <i>Indians</i> that are
in the <i>English</i> Interest, there are very many Nations of <i>Indians</i>, who
are, at present, in the Interest of the <i>French</i>, and who lie between
<i>New-York</i>, and the Nations of <i>Indians</i> in the <i>English Interest</i>; and
this Act prohibiting all Trade between <i>New-York</i> and the <i>French</i> of
<i>Canada</i>, or any of the Subjects of <i>France</i>, the <i>French</i>, and their
<i>Indians</i>, would not permit the <i>English Indians</i> to pass over by their
Forts, so as to carry on a free Trade with <i>New-York</i>, but prevented
their Passages, as much as possible, whereby that most considerable and
only valuable Branch of Trade from <i>New-York</i>, hath, ever since the
passing the said Act, very much lessened, from the great Difficulties of
carrying on any Trade with the <i>English Indians</i>, and the Prohibition of
all Trade with the <i>French</i>; and all the <i>Indian Goods</i> have, by this
Act, been raised in their Price 25<i>l.</i> to 30<i>l.</i> <i>per Cent</i>.</p>

<p>Whereas, on the other hand, this Branch of the <i>New-York</i> Trade, by the
Discouragements brought upon it by this Act, is almost wholly engrossed
by the <i>French</i>, who have already, by this Act, been encouraged to send
proper <i>European Goods</i> to <i>Canada</i>, to carry on this Trade; so that
should this Act be continued, the <i>New-York</i> Trade, which is very
considerable, must be wholly lost to us, and center in the <i>French</i>.</p>

<p>And your Petitioners further beg leave humbly to represent, That as they
conceive nothing can tend more to the with-drawing the Affections of the
<i>Five Nations</i> of <i>Indians</i> from the <i>English Interest</i>, than the
Continuance of the said Act, which, in its Effects, restrains them from
a free Commerce with the Inhabitants of <i>New-York</i>, and may, too
probably, estrange them from the <i>English Interest:</i> Whereas by a
Freedom of Commerce, and an encourag'd Intercourse of Trade with the
<i>French</i>, and their <i>Indians</i>, the <i>English Interest</i> might, in time, be
greatly improved and strengthened among the <i>Indians</i> in general, who,
by such Latitude of Trade, might be link'd to our Friendship in the
strongest Ties of their own Interest, as well as Inclinations.</p>

<p>That therefore, and as the said Act was, in its Effects, so plainly
destructive and prejudicial to the Trade and Interest of these Kingdoms,
and so much for the Interest of the <i>French</i>, and greatly promoted that
Mischief which it was intended to prevent,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Your Petitioners most humbly pray your Majesty, That you would
be graciously pleased to give the necessary Directions to your
Governor of <i>New-York</i>, not to pass any new Act for the reviving
or continuing the said Act prohibiting Trade with the <i>French</i>
of <i>Canada</i>; and that if any such Act, or any Act of the like
Tendency, be already passed, that the same may be repealed. <i>And
your Petitioners shall ever pray</i>, &amp;c.</p></div>

<h4><span class="gesperrt">PRESENT</span></h4>

<h4>The <span class="smcap"><span class="gesperrt">King</span></span>'s Most Excellent Majesty in Council.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">U</span>pon Reading this Day at the Board the humble Petition and
Representation of <i>Samuel Baker, Samuel Storke</i>, and several others,
Merchants of <i>London</i>, trading to <i>New-York</i>, in behalf of themselves,
and the rest of the Persons concern'd in the <i>New-York</i> Trade, which
<i>Petition</i> sets forth, That great Discouragements have been brought upon
the <i>British Trade</i>, by an Act passed in the said Colony of <i>New York</i>,
the 19th of <i>November</i>, 1720, entitled, <i>An Act for the Encouragement
of the</i> Indian Trade, <i>and rendering of it more beneficial to the
Inhabitants of this Province, and for prohibiting the selling of</i> Indian
Goods <i>to the</i> French. And that as the said Act was to continue in force
only for three Years, they are informed the Government of <i>New-York</i>
either have, or are about passing an Act to revive and continue the
same: Wherefore they humbly pray, that the Governor of that Colony may
be ordered, not to pass any new Act for that purpose; and if any such
Act be already pass'd, that it may be repealed.</p>

<p>It is ordered by his Majesty in Council, That the said Petition (a Copy
whereof is hereunto annexed) be, and it is hereby referred to the Lords
Commissioners for Trade and Plantations, to examine into the same, and
report to his Majesty, at this Board, what they conceive fit to be done
therein.</p>

<h4><i>Extract of the Minutes of the Right Honourable the Lords
Commissioners for Trade and Plantations, the</i> 7<i>th of</i> July, 1724.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>r. <i>Sharp</i> attending, as he had been desired, with several <i>New-York</i>
Merchants, their Lordships took again into Consideration the Order of
Council of the 30th of <i>April</i>, mentioned in the Minutes of the first of
<i>May</i> last, referring to the Board their Petition against the Renewing
an Act passed in <i>New-York</i>, in <i>November</i>, 1720, entitled, <i>An Act for
the Encouragement of the</i> Indian <i>Trade</i>, <i>and rendering of it more
effectual to the Inhabitants of this Province, and for prohibiting the
selling of</i> Indian <i>Goods to the</i> French. And Mr. <i>Sharp</i>, in behalf of
the several Merchants, acquainted their Lordships, That he conceived
this Act, tho' its Intention of gaining the <i>Indians</i> to the <i>English</i>
Interest might be good, would have quite a contrary Effect, because, if
the Trade with the <i>French</i> was prevented, and the Merchants should
discontinue that with the <i>Indians</i>, (as he was informed they would) the
<i>French</i> might lay hold of this Opportunity to furnish themselves with
Goods from <i>Europe</i>, and supply the Five Nations of <i>Indians</i>, and
thereby gain them to their Interest: And this, by reason of their
Situation, would not be in the Power of the <i>English</i> to prevent: That
they were two or three hundred Leagues distant from <i>Albany</i>, and that
they could not come to trade with the <i>English</i> but by going down the
River <i>St. Laurence</i>, and from thence through a Lake, which brought them
within eighteen Leagues of <i>Albany</i>.</p>

<p>And that the <i>French</i> having made Settlements along the said River, it
would be in their Power, whenever they pleased, to cut off that
Communication.</p>

<p>That this Act had been so great a Discouragement to the <i>British Trade</i>,
in general, that there had not been, by far, so great a Quantity of
Beaver, and other Furs, imported into <i>Great-Britain</i> since the passing
the said Act, as there was before; nor half the Quantity of <i>European
Goods</i> exported.</p>

<p>That several Merchants who had sent over to <i>New-York</i> considerable
Quantities of <i>European Goods</i>, had received Advice from their
Correspondents, That should another Act of the like Nature be passed,
they could not find a vent for them, and desired they would send no
more.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, Mr. <i>Sharp</i> desired, in behalf of the Merchants, that
Mr. <i>Burnet</i> might be directed not to pass any Act of the like Nature
for the future.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<h4>To the <span class="smcap"><span class="gesperrt">King</span></span>'s Most Excellent Majesty.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>May it please your Majesty</i>;<br />
</p></div>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n Obedience to your Majesty's Commands, signified to us by your Order
in Council of the 30th of <i>April</i> last, referring to us the Petition of
several Merchants of <i>London</i> trading to <i>New-York</i>, setting forth "The
great Discouragements that have been brought upon the <i>British Trade</i> by
an Act passed in <i>New-York</i> the 19th of <i>November</i>, 1720, entitled, <i>An
Act for the Encouragement of the</i> Indian Trade, <i>and rendering of it
more beneficial to the Inhabitants of this Province, and for prohibiting
the selling of</i> Indian Goods <i>to the</i> French. And that as the said Act
is now expir'd, the said Merchants are informed the Government of
<i>New-York</i> either have, or are about passing an Act to revive and
continue the same; and therefore pray, that a stop may be put thereto."
We humbly take leave to represent to your Majesty,</p>

<p>That we have been attended by the Petitioners, who informed us, that
they have found this Act, by Experience, to be so great a Discouragement
to the <i>British Trade</i>, that there has not been, by far, so considerable
a Quantity of Beaver, and other Furs, imported into <i>Great-Britain</i>,
from <i>New-York</i>, since the passing the said Act, as heretofore, nor half
the Quantity of <i>European Goods</i> exported thither; in consequence
whereof the Price of Furs is raised <i>Five and Twenty</i> and <i>Thirty per
Cent.</i> to the great Prejudice of several <i>British</i> Manufactures.</p>

<p>They likewise affirmed, That it was impracticable to hinder the <i>French</i>
from supplying the <i>Indians</i> with <i>European</i> Goods: For tho' <i>New-York</i>
should not furnish them, the <i>French</i> would find another way to be
supplied therewith, either from some other of his Majesty's
Plantations, or, it might be, directly from <i>Europe</i>. That it was of
dangerous Consequence to force this Trade into a new Channel, many of
the Goods which the <i>Indians</i> want being as easy to be had directly from
<i>France</i> or <i>Holland</i>, as from <i>Great-Britain</i>.</p>

<p>They further added, That it was not likely the Act, in question, should
produce the Effects expected from it, more particularly that of securing
the Five <i>Indian</i> Nations firmly to the <i>British</i> Interest; because, if
the <i>French</i> should once get a Supply of the Goods necessary for the
<i>Indian</i> Trade, from any other Place, as the Five <i>Indian</i> Nations are
settled upon the Banks of the River of <i>St. Lawrence</i>, directly opposite
to <i>Quebeck</i>, two or three hundred Leagues distant from the nearest
<i>British</i> Settlement in <i>New-York</i>, the Vicinity of the <i>French</i> would
furnish them with the Means of supplying even the <i>Five Nations</i> with
these Goods, and consequently of alienating their Affections from the
<i>British</i> Interest. And that there was no Prospect of obtaining a Trade
with the <i>French Indians</i> by this means, because the French would always
be able to prevent their Passage cross the Lakes and River of <i>St.
Lawrence</i> to our Settlements.</p>

<p>These were the most material Objections made by the Merchants against
the Bill.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On the other hand, the Preamble of the Act sets forth, That it was found
by Experience, that the <i>French</i> of <i>Canada</i>, by means of <i>Indian</i> Goods
brought from that Province, had not only almost wholly engrossed the
<i>Indian</i> Trade, but had in great Measure, withdrawn the Affections of
the <i>Five Nations</i> of <i>Indians</i> from the Inhabitants of that Province,
and rendered them wavering in their Allegiance to your Majesty; and
would, if such Trade were not prevented, altogether alienate the Minds
of the said <i>Indians</i>, which would prove of dangerous Consequence to
the <i>English</i> Interest in <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>And Mr. <i>Burnet</i>, your Majesty's Governor of <i>New-York</i>, informs us,
That, since the passing of this Act, several of the far <i>Indians</i> had
come to <i>Albany</i> to trade; That some of them came above one thousand
Miles, and are now incorporated with the <i>Five Nations</i>: That he had
likewise Intelligence of more far <i>Indians</i> that design'd to come to
<i>Albany</i>, which he conceives to have been a good Effect proceeding from
this Act: And likewise adds, That he did not doubt but the Cheapness of
Goods in <i>Albany</i> would induce the <i>Indians</i> to trade there, rather than
with the <i>French</i> at <i>Montreal</i>; and that the Traders of <i>Albany</i> began
to be sensible of their Error in sharing a Trade with the <i>French</i>,
which they now perceive they can keep wholly to themselves.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Upon the whole</i>, being doubtful of some of the Facts alledged by the
Merchants, and considering how far the <i>British Trade</i> may be affected
by this Act, on the one hand; and how much the Security and Interest of
your Majesty's Colonies in <i>America</i> may be concerned, on the other, we
are humbly of Opinion, That no Directions should be sent to <i>New-York</i>,
upon the Subject-Matter of this Act, till Mr. <i>Burnet</i> shall have been
acquainted with the Objections of the Merchants thereto, and his Answers
and Observations received thereupon. For which end, if your Majesty
shall be graciously pleased to approve of this our Proposal, we shall
forthwith send him Copies both of the Merchants Memorial, and of what
Objections they have made before us to the Subject-Matter of this Bill.</p>

<p>Which is most humbly submitted. Signed,</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n Obedience to your Excellency's Commands in Council, the 29th of
<i>October</i>, referring to us a Petition of several Merchants in <i>London</i>,
presented to the King's most excellent Majesty, against renewing an Act
passed in this Province, entitled, <i>An Act for Encouragement of the</i>
Indian <i>Trade, and rendering it more effectual to the Inhabitants of
this Province, and for prohibiting the selling of</i> Indian <i>Goods to the</i>
French; as likewise the several Allegations of the said Merchants before
the Right Hon. the Lords of Trade and Plantations, we beg Leave to make
the following Remarks.</p>

<p>In order to make our Observations the more distinct and clear, we shall
gather together the several Assertions of the said Merchants, both in
their Petition, and delivered verbally before the Lords of Trade, as to
the Situation of this Province, with respect to the <i>French</i> and <i>Indian
Nations</i>, and observe on them, in the first Place, they being the
Foundation on which all their other Allegations are grounded. Afterwards
we shall lay before your Excellency, what we think necessary to observe
on the other parts of the said Petition, in the Order they are in the
Petition, or in the Report of the Lords of Trade.</p>

<p>In their geographical Accounts they say, "Besides the Nations of
<i>Indians</i> that are in the <i>English</i> Interest, there are very many
Nations of <i>Indians</i>, who are at present in the Interest of the
<i>French</i>, and who lie between <i>New-York</i> and the Nations of <i>Indians</i> in
the <i>English</i> Interest.&mdash;&mdash;The <i>French</i> and their <i>Indians</i> would not
permit the <i>English Indians</i> to pass over by their Forts."</p>

<p>The said Act "Restrains them (<i>the Five Nations</i>) from a free Commerce
with the Inhabitants of <i>New-York</i>.</p>

<p>"The <i>Five Indian Nations</i> are settled upon the Banks of the River <i>St.
Lawrence</i>, directly opposite to <i>Quebeck</i>, two or three Hundred Leagues
distant from the nearest <i>British</i> Settlements in <i>New-York</i>.</p>

<p>"They (<i>the Five Nations of Indians</i>) were two or three Hundred Leagues
distant from <i>Albany</i>; and that they could not come to trade with the
<i>English</i> but by going down the River <i>St. Lawrence</i>, and from thence
through a Lake, which brought them within eighteen Leagues of <i>Albany</i>."</p>

<p>These Things the Merchants have thought it safe for them, and consistent
with their Duty to his sacred Majesty, to say in his Majesty's Presence,
and to repeat them afterwards before the Right Hon. the Lords of Trade,
though nothing can be more directly contrary to the Truth. For there are
no Nations of <i>Indians</i> between <i>New-York</i> and the Nations of <i>Indians</i>
in the <i>English Interest</i>, who are now six in Number, by the Addition of
the <i>Tuscaroras</i>. The <i>Mohawks</i> (called <i>Annies</i> by the <i>French</i>) one of
the Five Nations, live on the South-side of a Branch of
<i>Hudson's-River</i>, (not on the North-side, as they are placed in the
<i>French</i> Maps) and but forty Miles directly West from <i>Albany</i>, and
within the <i>English</i> Settlements, some of the <i>English</i> Farms upon the
same River being thirty Miles further West.</p>

<p>The <i>Oneidas</i> (the next of the Five Nations) lie likewise West from
<i>Albany</i>, near the Head of the <i>Mohawks-River</i>, about one Hundred Miles
from <i>Albany</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Onondagas</i> lie about one Hundred and Thirty Miles West from
<i>Albany</i>. And the <i>Tuscaroras</i> live partly with the <i>Oneidas</i>, and
partly with the <i>Onondagas</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Cayugas</i> are about one hundred and sixty Miles from <i>Albany</i>.</p>

<p>And the <i>Sennekas</i> (the furthest of all these Nations) are not above two
hundred and forty Miles from <i>Albany</i>, as may appear by Mr. <i>De
L'Isle</i>'s Map of <i>Louisiane</i>, who lays down the Five Nations under the
Name of <i>Iroquois</i>.</p>

<p>And Goods are daily carried from this Province to the <i>Sennekas</i>, as
well as to those Nations that lie nearer, by Water all the Way, except
three Miles, (or in the dry Seasons, five Miles) where the Traders carry
over Land between the <i>Mohawks-River</i> and the <i>Wood Creek</i>, which runs
into the <i>Oneida-Lake</i>, without going near either <i>St. Lawrence-River</i>,
or any of the <i>Lakes</i> upon which the <i>French</i> pass, which are entirely
out of their Way.</p>

<p>The nearest <i>French</i> Forts or Settlements to <i>Albany</i>, are <i>Chambly</i> and
<i>Monreal</i>, both of them lying about North and by East from <i>Albany</i>, and
are near two hundred Miles distant from it. <i>Quebeck</i> lies about three
hundred and eighty Miles North-East from <i>Albany</i>. So far is it from
being true, that the Five Nations are situated upon the Banks of the
<i>River St. Lawrence</i>, opposite to <i>Quebeck</i>, that <i>Albany</i> lies almost
directly between <i>Quebeck</i> and the <i>Five Nations</i>. And to say that these
<i>Indians</i> cannot come to trade at <i>Albany</i>, but by going down the <i>River
St. Lawrence</i>, and then into a <i>Lake</i> eighteen Leagues from <i>Albany</i> (we
suppose they mean <i>Lake Champlain</i>) passing by the <i>French</i> Forts, is to
the same Purpose as if they should say, that one cannot go from <i>London</i>
to <i>Bristol</i>, but by Way of <i>Edinburgh</i>.</p>

<p>Before we go on to observe other Particulars, we beg Leave further to
remark, that it is so far from being true, that the <i>Indians</i> in the
<i>French</i> Interest, lie between <i>New-York</i> and our <i>Five Nations of
Indians</i>, that some of our Nations of <i>Indians</i> lie between the <i>French</i>
and the <i>Indians</i>, from whence the <i>French</i> bring the far greatest
Quantity of their Furs: For the <i>Sennekas</i> (whom the <i>French</i> call
<i>Sonontouons</i>) are situated between <i>Lake Erie</i> and <i>Cataraqui Lake</i>,
(called by the <i>French Ontario</i>) near the great Fall of <i>Jagara</i>, by
which all the <i>Indians</i> that live round <i>Lake Erie</i>, round the Lake of
the <i>Hurons</i>, round the Lake of the <i>Illenois</i>, or <i>Michegan</i>, and round
the great <i>Upper Lake</i>, generally pass in their Way to <i>Canada</i>. All the
<i>Indians</i> situated upon the Branches of the <i>Misissippi</i>, must likewise
pass by the same Place, if they go to <i>Canada</i>. And all of them likewise
in their Way to <i>Canada</i>, pass by our Trading-Place upon the <i>Cataraqui
Lake</i>, at the Mouth of the <i>Onondaga River</i>. The nearest and safest Way
of carrying Goods upon the <i>Cataraqui Lake</i> towards <i>Canada</i>, being
along the South-side of that Lake, (near where our <i>Indians</i> are
settled, and our Trade of late is fixed) and not by the North-side and
<i>Cataraqui</i>, or <i>Frontinac Fort</i>, where the <i>French</i> are settled.</p>

<p>Now that we have represented to your Excellency, that not one Word of
the Geography of these Merchants is true, upon which all their Reasoning
is founded, it might seem needless to trouble your Excellency with any
further Remarks, were it not to show with what earnestness they are
promoting the <i>French Interest</i>, to the Prejudice of all his Majesty's
Colonies in <i>North America</i>, and that they are not ashamed of asserting
any Thing for that End, even in the Royal Presence.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, They say, "That by the Act passed in this Province, entitled,
<i>An Act for Encouragement of the</i> Indian <i>Trade, &amp;c</i>. All Trade
whatsoever is prohibited in the strictest Manner, and under the severest
Penalties, between the Inhabitants of <i>New-York</i> Government, and the
<i>French</i> of <i>Canada</i>."</p>

<p>This is not true, for only carrying Goods to the <i>French</i>, which are
proper for the <i>Indian Trade</i>, is prohibited. The Trade as to other
Things, is left in the same State it was before that Act was made, as it
will appear to any Person that shall read it: And there are yearly large
Quantities of other Goods openly carried to <i>Canada</i>, without any
Hindrance from the Government of <i>New-York</i>. Whatever may be said of the
Severity and Penalties in that Act, they are found insufficient to deter
some from carrying Goods clandestinely to the <i>French</i>; and the
Legislature of this Province are convinced that no Penalties can be too
severe, to prevent a Trade which puts the Safety of all his Majesty's
Subjects of <i>North America</i> in the greatest Danger.</p>

<p>Their next Assertion is, <i>All the</i> Indian <i>Goods have by this Act, been
raised</i> 25 l. <i>to</i> 30 l. <i>per Cent</i>. This is the only Allegation in the
whole Petition, that there is any Ground for. Nevertheless, though the
common Channel of Trade cannot be altered without some Detriment to it
in the Beginning, we are assured from the Custom-house Books, that there
has been every Year, since the passing of this Act, more Furs exported
from <i>New-York</i>, than in the Year immediately before the passing of this
Act. It is not probable, that the greatest Difference between the
Exportation any Year before this Act, and any Year since, could so much
alter the Price of Beaver, as it is found to be this last Year. Beaver
is carried to <i>Britain</i> from other Parts besides <i>New-York</i>, and it is
certain that the Price of Beaver is not so much altered here by the
Quantity in our Market, as by the Demand for it in <i>Britain</i>. But as we
cannot be so well informed here, what occasions Beaver to be in greater
Demand in <i>Britain</i>, we must leave that to be enquired after in
<i>England</i>. However, we are fully satisfied that it will be found to be
for very different Reasons from what the Merchants alledge.</p>

<p>The Merchants go on and say, <i>Whereas on the other Hand, this Branch of
the</i> New-York <i>Trade, by the Discouragements brought upon it by this
Act, is almost wholly engrossed by the</i> French, <i>who have already by
this Act, been encouraged to send proper</i> European Goods <i>to</i> Canada,
<i>to carry on this Trade, so that should this Act be continued, the</i>
New-York <i>Trade which is very considerable, must be wholly lost to us,
and center in the</i> French.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Though</i> New-York <i>should not furnish
them, the</i> French <i>would find another</i> Way <i>to be supplied therewith,
either from some other of his Majesty's Plantations, or it might be
directly from Europe</i>.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Many of the Goods which the</i> Indians <i>want
being as easy to be had directly from</i> France <i>or</i> Holland, <i>as from</i>
Great-Britain.</p>

<p>This is easily answered, by informing your Excellency, that the
principal of the Goods proper for the <i>Indian Market</i> are only of the
Manufactures of <i>Great-Britain</i>, or of the <i>British Plantations, viz</i>.
Strouds, or Stroud-Waters, and other Woollens, and Rum. The <i>French</i>
must be obliged to buy all their Woollens (the Strouds especially) in
<i>England</i>, and thence carry them to <i>France</i>, in order to their
Transportation to <i>Canada</i>. The Voyage to <i>Quebeck</i> through the Bay of
<i>St. Lawrence</i>, is well known to be the most dangerous of any in the
World, and only practicable in the Summer Months. The <i>French</i> have no
Commodities in <i>Canada</i>, by reason of the Cold and Barrenness of the
Soil, proper for the <i>West-India</i> Markets, and therefore have no Rum but
by Vessels from <i>France</i>, that touch at their Islands in the
<i>West-Indies</i>. <i>New-York</i> has, by Reason of its Situation, both as to
the Sea and the <i>Indians</i>, every Way the Advantage of <i>Canada</i>. The
<i>New-York</i> Vessels make always two Voyages in the Year from <i>England</i>,
one in Summer and another in Winter, and several Voyages in a Year to
the <i>West-Indies</i>. It is manifest therefore, that it is not in the Power
of the <i>French</i> to import any Goods near so cheap to <i>Canada</i>, as they
are imported to <i>New-York</i>.</p>

<p>But to put this out of all Controversy, we need only observe to your
Excellency, That Strouds (without which no considerable Trade can be
carried on with the <i>Indians</i>) are sold at <i>Albany</i> for 10 <i>l.</i> a Piece:
They were sold at <i>Monreal</i> before this Act took Place, at 13 <i>l.</i> 2
<i>s.</i> 6 <i>d.</i> and now they are sold there for 25 <i>l.</i> and upwards: Which
is an evident Proof, that the <i>French</i> have not, in these four Years
Time (during the Continuance of this Act) found out any other Way to
supply themselves with Strouds, and likewise that they cannot trade
without them, seeing they buy them at so extravagant a Price.</p>

<p>It likewise appears, that none of the neighbouring Colonies have been
able to supply the <i>French</i> with these Goods; and those that know the
Geography of the Country, know it is impracticable to do it at any
tolerable Rate, because they must carry their Goods ten Times further by
Land than we need to do.</p>

<p>We are likewise assured, that the Merchants of <i>Monreal</i> lately told Mr.
<i>Vaudreuil</i> their Governor, that if the Trade from <i>Albany</i> be not by
some Means or other encouraged, they must abandon that Settlement. We
have Reason therefore to suspect, that these Merchants (at least some of
them) have been practised upon by the <i>French</i> Agents in <i>London</i>; for
no doubt, the <i>French</i> will leave no Method untried to defeat the
present Designs of this Government, seeing they are more afraid of the
Consequences of this Trade between <i>New-York</i> and the <i>Indians</i>, than of
all the warlike Expeditions that ever were attempted against <i>Canada</i>.</p>

<p>But to return to the Petitioners, <i>They conceive nothing can tend more
to the withdrawing the Affections of the</i> Five Nations of Indians <i>from
the</i> English Interest, <i>than the Continuance of the said Act, which in
its Effects restrains them from a free Commerce with the Inhabitants of</i>
New-York, <i>and may too probably, estrange them from the</i> English
Interest, <i>whereas by a Freedom of Commerce, and an encouraged
Intercourse of Trade with the</i> French <i>and their</i> Indians, <i>the</i> English
<i>Interest might in Time, be greatly improved and strengthened</i>.</p>

<p>It seems to us a strange Argument to say, that an Act, the whole Purport
of which is to encourage our own People to go among the <i>Indians</i>, and
to draw the far <i>Indians</i> through our <i>Indian Country</i> to <i>Albany</i> (and
which has truly produced these Effects) would on the contrary, restrain
them from a free Commerce with the Inhabitants of <i>New-York</i>, and may
too probably estrange them from the <i>English Interest</i>, and therefore
that it would be much wiser in us to make use of the <i>French</i>, to
promote the <i>English Interest</i>; and for which End, we ought to encourage
a free Intercourse between them and our <i>Indians</i>. The reverse of this
is exactly true, in the Opinion of our <i>Five Nations</i>; who in all their
publick Treaties with this Government, have represented against this
Trade, as <i>The Building the</i> French <i>Forts with</i> English <i>Strouds</i>: That
the encouraging a Freedom of Commerce with our <i>Indians</i>, and the
<i>Indians</i> round them, who must pass through their Country to <i>Albany</i>,
would certainly increase both the <i>English Interest</i> and theirs, among
all the Nations to the Westward of them; and that the carrying the
<i>Indian Market</i> to <i>Monreal</i> in <i>Canada</i>, draws all the far <i>Indians</i>
thither.</p>

<p>The last Thing we have to take Notice, is what the Merchants asserted
before the Lords of Trade, <i>viz. That there has not been half the
Quantity of</i> European <i>Goods exported since the passing of this Act,
that used to be</i>.</p>

<p>We are well assured, that this is no better grounded than the other
Facts they assert with the same Positiveness. For it is well known
almost to every Person in <i>New-York</i>, that there has not been a less,
but rather a greater Quantity of <i>European Goods</i> imported into this
Place, since the passing of this Act, than was at any Time before it, in
the same Space of Time. As this appears by the Manifests in the
Custom-house here, the same may likewise be easily proved by the
Custom-house Books in <i>London</i>.</p>

<p>As all the Arguments of the Merchants run upon the ill Effects this Act
has had upon the Trade and the Minds of the <i>Indians</i>, every one of
which we have shown to be asserted without the least Foundation to
support them, there nothing now remains, but to show the good Effects
this Act has produced, which are so notorious in this Province, that we
know not one Person that now opens his Mouth against the Act.</p>

<p>Before this Act passed, none of the People of this Province travelled
into the <i>Indian Countries</i> to trade: We have now above forty young Men,
who have been several Times as far as the Lakes a trading, and thereby
become well acquainted, not only with the Trade of the <i>Indians</i>, but
likewise with their Manners and Languages; and these have returned with
such large Quantities of Furs, that greater Numbers are resolved to
follow their Example. So that we have good Reason to hope, that in a
little Time the <i>English</i> will draw the whole <i>Indian</i> Trade of the
Inland Countries to <i>Albany</i>, and into the Country of the <i>Five
Nations</i>. This Government has built a publick Trading-house upon
<i>Cataraqui Lake</i>, at <i>Irondequat</i> in the <i>Sennekas</i> Land, and another is
to be built next Spring, at the Mouth or the <i>Onondagas River</i>. All the
far <i>Indians</i> pass by these Places, in their Way to <i>Canada</i>; and they
are not above half so far from the <i>English</i> Settlements, as they are
from the <i>French</i>.</p>

<p>So far is it from being true what the Merchants say, <i>That the</i> French
<i>Forts interrupt all Communication between the</i> Indians <i>and the</i>
English, that if these Places be well supported, as they easily can be
from our Settlements, in case of a Rupture with the <i>French</i>, it will
be in the Power of this Province, to intercept the greatest Part of the
Trade between <i>Canada</i> and the <i>Indians</i>, round the Lakes and the
Branches of the <i>Misissippi</i>.</p>

<p>Since this Act passed, many Nations have come to <i>Albany</i> to trade, and
settle Peace and Friendship, whose Names had not so much as been heard
of among us.</p>

<p>In the Beginning of <i>May</i> 1723, a Nation of <i>Indians</i> came to <i>Albany</i>
singing and dancing, with their Calumets before them, as they always do
when they come to any Place where they have not been before. We do not
find that the Commissioners of <i>Indian</i> Affairs, were able to inform
themselves what Nation this was.</p>

<p>Towards the End of the same Month, eighty Men, besides Women and
Children, came to <i>Albany</i> in the same Manner. These had one of our Five
Nations with them for an Interpreter, by whom they informed the
Commissioners, that they were of a great Nation, called <i>Nehkereages</i>,
consisting of six Castles and Tribes; and that they lived near a Place
called by the <i>French Missilimakinak</i>, between the Upper Lake and the
Lake of the <i>Hurons</i>. These <i>Indians</i> not only desired a free Commerce,
but likewise to enter into a strict League of Friendship with us and our
<i>Six Nations</i>, that they might be accounted the <i>Seventh Nation</i> in the
League; and being received accordingly, they left their Calumet as a
Pledge of their Fidelity.</p>

<p>In <i>June</i> another Nation arrived, but from what Part of the Continent we
have not learned.</p>

<p>In <i>July</i> the <i>Twightwies</i> arrived, and brought an <i>Indian</i> Interpreter
of our Nations with them, who told, that they were called by the <i>French
Miamies</i>, and that they live upon one of the Branches of the River
<i>Misissippi</i>.</p>

<p>At the same Time some of the <i>Tahsagrondie Indians</i>, who live between
<i>Lake Erie</i> and the Lake of the <i>Hurons</i>, near a <i>French</i> Settlement,
did come and renew their League with the <i>English</i>, nor durst the
<i>French</i> hinder them.</p>

<p>In <i>July</i> this Year, another Nation came, whose Situation and Name we
know not. And in <i>August</i> and <i>September</i>, several Parties of the same
<i>Indians</i> that had been here last Year. But the greatest Numbers of
these far <i>Indians</i> have been met this Year, in the <i>Indian</i> Country by
our Traders, every one of them endeavouring to get before another, in
order to reap the Profits of so advantageous a Trade, which has all this
Summer long, kept about forty Traders constantly employed, in going
between our Trading-places in our <i>Indian</i> Country, and <i>Albany</i>.</p>

<p>All these Nations of <i>Indians</i> who came to <i>Albany</i> said, that the
<i>French</i> had told them many strange Stories of the <i>English</i>, and did
what they could to hinder their coming to <i>Albany</i>, but that they had
resolved to break through by Force. The Difference on this Score between
the <i>Tahsagrondie Indians</i> and the <i>French</i> (who have a Fort and
Settlement there, called by them <i>Le Detroit</i>) rose to that Height this
Summer, that Mr. <i>Tonti</i> who commanded there, thought it proper to
retire, and return to <i>Canada</i> with many of his Men.</p>

<p>We are for these Reasons well assured, that this Year there will be more
Beaver exported for <i>Great-Britain</i>, than ever was from this Province in
one Year; and that if the Custom-house Books at <i>London</i> be looked into,
it will be found, that there will be a far greater Quantity of Goods for
the <i>Indians</i>, (Strouds especially) sent over next Spring, than ever was
at any one Time to this Province; for the Merchants here tell us, that
they have at this Time, ordered more of these Goods, than ever was done
at any one Time before.</p>

<p>These Matters of Fact prove beyond Contradiction, that this Act has been
of the greatest Service to <i>New-York</i>, in making us acquainted with many
Nations of <i>Indians</i>, formerly entirely unknown and Strangers to us; in
withdrawing them from their Dependance upon the <i>French</i>, and in uniting
them to <i>us</i> and <i>our Indians</i>, by Means of Trade and mutual Offices of
Friendship. Of what great Consequence this may be to the <i>British
Interest</i> in general, as to Trade, is apparent to any Body. It is no
less apparent likewise, that it is of the greatest Consequence to the
Safety of all the <i>British Colonies</i> in <i>North-America</i>. We feel too
sensibly, the ill Effects of the <i>French Interest</i> in the present War
betwixt <i>New-England</i>, and only one Nation of <i>Indians</i> supported by the
<i>French</i>. Of what dismal Consequences then might it be, if the <i>French</i>
should be able to influence in the same Manner, so many and such
numerous <i>Nations</i>, as lie to the Westward of <i>this Province,
Pensylvania</i> and <i>Maryland</i>? On the other Hand, if all these <i>Nations</i>
(who assert their own Freedom, and declare themselves Friends to those
that supply them best with what they want) be brought to have a
Dependance upon the <i>English</i> (as we have good Reason to hope, in a
short Time they will) the <i>French</i> of <i>Canada</i>, in case of a War, must
be at the Mercy of the <i>English</i>.</p>

<p>To these Advantages must be added, that many of our young Men having
been induced by this Act to travel among the <i>Indians</i>, they learn their
Manners, their Languages, and the Situation of all their Countries, and
become inured to all Manner of Fatigues and Hardships, and a great many
more being resolved to follow their Example; these young Men, in case of
a War with the <i>Indians</i>, will be of ten Times the Service, that the
same Number of the common Militia can be of.</p>

<p>The Effects of this Act have likewise so much quieted the Minds of the
People, with Respect to the Security of the Frontiers, that our
Settlements are now extended above thirty Miles further West towards the
<i>Indian</i> Countries, than they were before it passed.</p>

<p>The only Thing that now remains to answer, is an Objection which we
suppose may be made, <i>What can induce the Merchants of</i> London <i>to
petition against an Act, which will be really so much for their Interest
in the End</i>? The Reason is in all Probability, because they only
consider their present Gain; and that they are not at all concerned for
the Safety of this Country, in encouraging the most necessary
Undertaking, if they apprehend their Profit for two or three Years may
be lessened by it. This Inclination of the Merchants has been so
notorious, that few Nations at War with their Neighbours, have been able
to restrain them from supplying their Enemies with Ammunition and Arms.
The Count <i>D'Estrade</i>, in his Letters in 1638 says, That when the
<i>Dutch</i> were besieging <i>Antwerp</i>, one <i>Beiland</i>, who had loaded four
Fly-boats with Arms and Powder for <i>Antwerp</i>, being taken up by the
Prince of <i>Orange</i>'s Order, and examined at <i>Amsterdam</i>, said boldly,
<i>That the Burghers of</i> Amsterdam <i>had a Right to trade every where: That
he could name a Hundred that were Factors for the Merchants at</i> Antwerp,
<i>and that he was one. That Trade cannot be interrupted, and that for his
Part he was very free to own, that if to get any Thing by Trade it were
necessary to pass through Hell, he would venture to burn his Sails</i>.
When this Principle so common to Merchants, is considered, and that some
in this Place have got Estates by trading many Years to <i>Canada</i>, it is
not to be wondered that they have acted as Factors for <i>Canada</i> in this
Affair, and that they have transmitted such Accounts to their
Correspondents in <i>London</i>, as are consistent with the Trust reposed in
them by the Merchants of <i>Canada</i>.</p>

<p>In the last Place, we are humbly of Opinion, that it may be proper to
print the Petition of the Merchants of <i>London</i>, and their Allegations
before the Lords of Trade, together with the Answers your Committee has
made thereto, in Vindication of the Legislature of this Province, of
which we have the Honour to be a Part, if your Excellency shall approve
of our Answers: That what we have said may be exposed to the Examination
of every one in this Place, where the Truth of the Matters of Fact is
best known; and that the Correspondents of these Merchants may have the
most publick Notice to reply, if they shall think it proper, or to
disown in a publick Manner, that they are the Authors of such groundless
Informations.</p>

<h4><i>A Memorial concerning the Furr-Trade of the Province of</i> New-York.</h4>

<h4><i>Presented to his Excellency</i> William Burnet, <i>Esq</i>; <i>Captain
General and Governor</i>, &amp;c. <i>by</i> Cadwallader Colden, <i>Surveyor
General of the said Province</i>, the 10<i>th of</i> November 1724.</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t has of late been generally believed, that the Inhabitants of the
Province of <i>New-York</i> are so advantageously situated, with respect to
the <i>Indian Trade</i>, and enjoy so many Advantages as to Trade in
general, that it is in their Power not only to rival the <i>French</i> of
<i>Canada</i>, who have almost entirely engrossed the Furr-Trade of
<i>America</i>, but that it is impossible for the <i>French</i> to carry on that
Trade in Competition with the People of this Province. The enquiring
into the Truth of this Proposition, may not only be of some Consequence,
as to the Riches and Honour of the <i>British Nation</i>, (for it is well
known how valuable the Furr-Trade of <i>America</i> is) but likewise as to
the Safety of all the <i>British Colonies</i> in <i>North-America</i>.
<i>New-France</i> (as the <i>French</i> now claim) extends from the Mouth of the
River <i>Misissippi</i>, to the Mouth of the River <i>St. Lawrence</i>, by which
the <i>French</i> plainly show their Intention of enclosing the <i>British
Settlements</i>, and cutting us off from all Commerce with the numerous
Nations of <i>Indians</i>, that are every where settled over the vast
Continent of <i>North-America</i>. The <i>English</i> in <i>America</i> have too good
Reason to apprehend such a Design, when they see the <i>French</i> King's
Geographer publish a Map, by which he has set Bounds to the <i>British
Empire</i> in <i>America</i>, and has taken in many of the <i>English Settlements</i>
both in <i>South-Carolina</i> and <i>New York</i>, within these Boundaries of
<i>New-France</i>. And the good Services they intend us, with the <i>Indians</i>,
but too plainly appears at this Day, by the <i>Indian War</i> now carried on
against <i>New-England</i>.</p>

<p>I have therefore for some Time past, endeavoured to inform myself, from
the Writings of the <i>French</i>, and from others who have travelled in
<i>Canada</i>, or among the <i>Indians</i>, how far the People of this Province
may carry on the <i>Indian Trade</i>, with more Advantage than the <i>French</i>
can; or what Disadvantages they labour under, more than the <i>French</i> do.
As all Endeavours for the good of ones Country are excusable, I do not
doubt but my Intention in this will be acceptable to your Excellency,
though I be not capable of treating the Subject as it deserves.</p>

<p>I shall begin with <i>Canada</i>, and consider what Advantages they have
either by their Situation, or otherwise. <i>Canada</i> is situated upon the
River of <i>St. Lawrence</i>, by which the five great Lakes (which may
properly be called, <i>The five Inland Seas of North-America</i>) empty
themselves into the Ocean. The Mouth of this great River is in the Lat.
of 50 Degrees, overagainst the Body of <i>Newfoundland</i>. It rises from the
<i>Cataracui Lake</i>, (the Eastermost of the five great Lakes) about the
Lat. of 44 Degrees, and runs from thence about North-East to the Ocean,
and is about nine hundred Miles in Length, from that Lake to the Ocean.
The five great Lakes which communicate with each other, and with this
River, extend about one thousand Miles Westward, further into the
Continent. So far the <i>French</i> have already discovered, and their
Discoveries make it probable, that an Inland Passage may be found to the
<i>South-Sea</i>, by the Rivers which run into these Lakes, and Rivers which
run into the <i>South-Sea</i>.</p>

<p>The Method of carrying Goods upon the Rivers of <i>North-America</i>, into
all the small Branches, and over Land, from the Branches of one River to
the Branches of another, was learned from the <i>Indians</i>, and is the only
Method practicable through such large Forests and Deserts as the Traders
pass thro', in carrying from one Nation to another, it is this; the
<i>Indians</i> make a long narrow Boat, made of the Bark of the Birch-tree,
the Parts of which they join very neatly. One of these Canoes that can
carry a Dozen Men, can itself be easily carried upon two Men's
Shoulders; so that when they have gone as far by Water as they can
(which is further than is easily to be imagined, because their loaded
Canoes don't sink six Inches into the Water) they unload their Canoes,
and carry both Goods and Canoes upon their Shoulders over Land, into the
nearest Branch of the River they intend to follow. Thus, the <i>French</i>
have an easy Communication with all the Countries bordering upon the
River of <i>St. Lawrence</i>, and its Branches, with all the Countries
bordering upon these In-land Seas, and the Rivers which empty themselves
into these Seas, and can thereby carry their Burdens of Merchandize
thro' all these large Countries, which could not by any other means than
Water-carriage be carried thro' so vast a Tract of Land.</p>

<p>This, however, but half finishes the View the <i>French</i> have, as to their
Commerce in <i>North-America</i>. Many of the Branches of the River
<i>Misissippi</i> come so near to the Branches of several of the Rivers which
empty themselves into the great Lakes, that in several Places there is
but a short Land-Carriage from the one to the other. As soon as they
have got into the River <i>Misissippi</i>, they open to themselves as large a
Field for Traffick in the southern Parts of <i>North-America</i>, as was
before mentioned with respect to the northern Parts. If one considers
the Length of this River, and its numerous Branches, he must say, <i>That
by means of this River, and the Lakes, there is opened to his View such
a Scene of inland Navigation as cannot be parallel'd in any other Part
of the World</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> have, with much Industry, settled small Colonies, and built
stockaded Forts at all the considerable Passes between the Lakes, except
between <i>Cataracui Lake</i> (called by the <i>French Ontario</i>) and <i>Lake
Erie</i>, one of our Five Nations of <i>Indians</i>, whom we call <i>Sennekas</i>,
(and the <i>French Sonontouans</i>) having hitherto refused them leave to
erect any Buildings there.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> have been indefatigable in making Discoveries, and carrying
on their Commerce with Nations, of whom the <i>English</i> know nothing but
what they see in the <i>French</i> Maps and Books. The Barrenness of the
Soil, and the Coldness of the Climate of <i>Canada</i>, obliges the greatest
number of the Inhabitants to seek their living by travelling among the
<i>Indians</i>, or by trading with those that do travel. The Governor, and
other Officers, have but a scanty Allowance from the King, and could not
subsist were it not by the Perquisites they have from this Trade;
neither could their Priests find any means to satisfy their Ambition and
Luxury without it: So that all Heads and Hands are employ'd to advance
it, and the Men of best Parts think it the surest way to advance
themselves by travelling among the <i>Indians</i>, and learning their
Languages; even the Bigotry and Enthusiasm of some hot Heads has not
been a little useful in advancing this Commerce; for that Government
having prudently turn'd the Edge of the Zeal of such hot Spirits upon
converting the <i>Indians</i>, many of them have spent their Lives under the
greatest Hardships, in endeavouring to gain the <i>Indians</i> to their
Religion, and to love the <i>French Nation</i>, while, at the same time, they
are no less industrious to represent the <i>English</i> as the <i>Enemies of
Mankind</i>. So that the whole Policy of that Government, both civil and
religious, is admirably turn'd to the general Advancement of this Trade.
Indeed the Art and Industry of the <i>French</i>, especially that of their
religious Missions, has so far prevail'd upon all the <i>Indians</i> in
<i>North-America</i>, that they are every where directed by <i>French
Councils</i>. Even our own <i>Five Nations</i>, (the <i>Iroquois</i>) who formerly
were mortal Enemies of the <i>French</i>, and have always liv'd in the
strictest Amity with the <i>English</i>, have, of late, (by the Practices of
the <i>French Priests</i>) been so far gain'd, that several of the <i>Mohawks</i>,
who live nearest the <i>English</i>, have left their Habitations, and are
gone to settle near <i>Monreal</i> in <i>Canada</i>; and all the rest discover a
Dread of the <i>French Power</i>. That much of this is truly owing to the
<i>Priests</i>, appears from many of the Sachems of the <i>Iroquois</i> wearing
Crucifixes when they come to <i>Albany</i>: And those <i>Mohawk Indians</i> that
are gone to <i>Canada</i>, are now commonly known, both to the <i>French</i> and
<i>English</i>, by the Name of <i>The Praying Indians</i>, it being customary for
them to go through the Streets of <i>Monreal</i> with their Beads, praying
and begging Alms.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding all these Advantages, the <i>French</i> labour under
Difficulties that no Art or Industry can remove. The Mouth of the River
of <i>St. Lawrence</i>, and more especially the Bay of <i>St. Lawrence</i>, lies
so far North, and is thereby so often subject to tempestuous Weather and
thick Fogs, that the Navigation there is very dangerous, and never
attempted but during the Summer Months. The Wideness of this Bay,
together with the many strong Currents that run in it, the many Shelves,
and sunken Rocks that are every where spread over both the Bay and
River, and the want of Places for anchoring in the Bay, all increase the
Danger of this Navigation; so that a Voyage to <i>Canada</i> is justly
esteem'd much more dangerous than to any other Part of <i>America</i>. The
many Shipwrecks that happen in this Navigation, are but too evident
Proofs of the Truth of this, particularly the Miscarriage of the last
Expedition against <i>Canada</i>. The Channel is so difficult, and the Tides
so strong, that after their Shipping get into the River, they never
attempt to sail in the Night, tho' the Wind be fair, and the Weather
good. These Difficulties are so considerable, that the <i>French</i> never
attempt above one Voyage in a Year to <i>Europe</i>, or the <i>West-Indies</i>,
tho' it be really nearer <i>Europe</i> than any of the <i>English Colonies</i>,
where the Shipping that constantly use the Trade, always make two
Voyages in the Year.</p>

<p>The Navigation between <i>Quebeck</i> and <i>Monreal</i> is likewise very
dangerous and difficult: The Tide rises about 18 or 20 Feet at
<i>Quebeck</i>, which occasions so strong a Stream, that a Boat of six Oars
cannot make way against it: The River in many Places very wide, and the
Channel at the same time narrow and crooked; there are many Shelves and
sunken Rocks, so that the best Pilots have been deceived; for which
reason the Vessels that carry Goods to <i>Monreal</i> are always obliged to
anchor before Night, tho' both Wind and Tide be fair. The Flood goes no
further than <i>Trois Rivieres</i>, half way to <i>Monreal</i>, and about ninety
Miles from <i>Quebeck</i>: After they pass this Place they have a strong
Stream always against them, which requires a fair Wind and a strong Gale
to carry the Vessels against the Stream. And they are obliged in this
Part of the River, as well as under the <i>Trois Rivieres</i>, to come to an
anchor at Night, though the Wind be good. These Difficulties make the
common Passages take up three or four Weeks, and sometimes six Weeks;
tho' if they have the chance of a Wind to continue so long, they may run
it in five or six Days.</p>

<p>After they pass <i>Monreal</i> they have a strong Stream against them till
they come near the Lakes; so that in all that, which is about one
hundred and fifty Miles in Length, they force their Canoes forward with
setting Poles, or drag them with Ropes along shoar; and at five or six
different Places in that way the River falls over Rocks with such Force,
that they are obliged to unload their Canoes, and carry them upon their
Shoulders. They never make this Voyage from <i>Monreal</i> to <i>Cataracui</i> in
less than twenty Days, and frequently, twice that Time is necessary.</p>

<p>Now we are come so far as the Lake, my Design leads me no further, for
at this Lake all the far <i>Indians</i>, that go to <i>Canada</i>, must pass by
our Traders. And from thence the Road to the <i>Indian Countries</i> is the
same from <i>Albany</i> that it is from <i>Monreal</i>.</p>

<p>Besides these Difficulties in the Transportation, the <i>French</i> labour
under greater in the purchasing of the principal Goods proper for the
<i>Indian Market</i>; for the most considerable and most valuable Part of
their Cargo consists in <i>Strouds, Duffils, Blankets</i>, and other
<i>Woollens</i>, which are bought at a much cheaper Rate in <i>England</i> than in
<i>France</i>. The <i>Strouds</i> (which the <i>Indians</i> value more than any other
Cloathing) are only made in <i>England</i>, and must be transported into
<i>France</i> before they can be carried to <i>Canada</i>. <i>Rum</i> is another
considerable Branch of the <i>Indian Trade</i>, which the <i>French</i> have not,
by reason they have no Commodities in <i>Canada</i> fit for the <i>West India</i>
Market. This they supply with <i>Brandy</i>, at a much dearer Rate than Rum
can be purchased at <i>New-York</i>, tho' of no more Value with the
<i>Indians</i>. Generally, all the Goods used in the <i>Indian Trade</i>, except
<i>Gun-Powder</i>, and a few Trinkets, are sold at <i>Monreal</i> for twice their
Value at <i>Albany</i>. To this likewise must be added, the necessity they
are under of laying the whole Charge of supporting their Government on
the <i>Indian Trade</i>. I am not particularly informed of their Duties or
Imposts, but I am well assured, that they commonly give six or seven
hundred Livres for a Licence for one Canoe, in proportion to her
Largeness, to go with her Loading into the <i>Indian Country</i> to trade.</p>

<p>I shall next consider the Advantages the Inhabitants of <i>New-York</i> have
in carrying on this Trade. In the <i>first</i> place, the Ships that
constantly use the Trade to <i>England</i>, perform their Voyage to and from
<i>London</i> twice every Year; and those that go to <i>Bristol</i> (the Port from
whence the greatest part of the Goods for the <i>Indian Trade</i> are
exported) frequently return in four Months. These Goods are bought much
cheaper in <i>England</i> than in <i>France</i>: They are transported in less
Time, with less Charge, and much less Risque, as appears by the <i>Premio</i>
for Insurance between <i>London</i> and <i>New-York</i>, being only <i>Two per
Cent</i>. Goods are easily carried from <i>New-York</i> to <i>Albany</i>, up
<i>Hudson's River</i>, the Distance being only 140 Miles, the River very
strait all the way, and bold, and very free from Sandbanks, as well as
Rocks; so that the Vessels always sail as well by Night as by Day, and
have the Advantage of the Tide upwards as well as downwards, the Flood
flowing above <i>Albany</i>. It may therefore be safely concluded, that all
sorts of Goods can be carried to <i>Albany</i> at a cheaper Rate than they
can be to <i>Quebeck</i>, which is also three times further from the <i>Indian
Country</i> than <i>Albany</i> is. To put the Truth of this out of all dispute,
I need only observe what is well known both at <i>New-York</i> and <i>Albany,
viz</i>. That almost all the Strouds carried by the <i>French</i> into the
<i>Indian Countries</i>, as well as large Quantities of other Goods, for the
Use of the <i>French</i> themselves, are carried from <i>Albany</i> to <i>Monreal</i>.
There has been an Account kept of nine hundred Pieces of Strouds
transported thither in one Year, besides other Commodities of very
considerable Value. The Distance between <i>Albany</i> and <i>Monreal</i> is about
two hundred Miles, all by Water, except twelve Miles between <i>Hudson's
River</i> and the <i>Wood-Creek</i>, where they carry their Bark Canoes over
Land, and about sixteen Miles between <i>Chambly</i> and <i>La Prairie</i>,
overagainst <i>Monreal</i>. And tho' the Passage be so short and easy, these
Goods are generally sold at double their Value in <i>Albany</i>.</p>

<p>But as this Path has been thought extremely prejudicial to the Interest
of this Colony, I shall leave it, and go on to another, that leads
directly from <i>Albany</i> into the <i>Cataracui</i> or <i>Ontario Lake</i>, without
going near any of the <i>French</i> Settlements.</p>

<p>From <i>Albany</i> the <i>Indian Traders</i> commonly carry their Goods sixteen
Miles over Land, to the <i>Mohawks River</i> at <i>Schenechtady</i>, the Charge of
which Carriage is <i>Nine Shillings New-York</i> Money, or <i>Five Shillings
Sterling</i> each Waggon-Load. From <i>Schenechtady</i> they carry them in
Canoes up the <i>Mohawks River</i>, to the Carrying-place between the
<i>Mohawks River</i>, and the River which runs into the <i>Oneida Lake</i>; which
Carrying-place between is only three Miles long, except in very dry
Weather, when they are obliged to carry them two Miles further. From
thence they go with the Current down the <i>Onondaga River</i> to the
<i>Cataracui Lake</i>. The Distance between <i>Albany</i> and the <i>Cataracui Lake</i>
(this Way) is nearly the same with that between <i>Albany</i> and <i>Monreal</i>;
and likewise with that between <i>Monreal</i> and the <i>Cataracui Lake</i>, and
the Passage much easier than the last, because the Stream of the
<i>Mohawks River</i> is not near so strong as the <i>Cataracui River</i> between
the <i>Lake</i> and <i>Monreal</i>, and there is no Fall in the River, save one
short one; whereas there are (as I have said) at least five in the
<i>Cataracui River</i>, where the Canoes must be unloaded. Therefore it
plainly follows, that the <i>Indian Goods</i> may be carried at as cheap a
Rate from <i>Albany</i> to the <i>Cataracui Lake</i>, as from <i>Albany</i> to
<i>Monreal</i>. So that the People of <i>Albany</i> plainly save all the Charge of
carrying Goods two hundred Miles from <i>Monreal</i> to that Part of the
<i>Cataracui Lake</i>, which the <i>French</i> have to carry before they bring
them to the same Place from <i>Monreal</i>, besides the Advantage which the
<i>English</i> have in the Price of their Goods.</p>

<p>I have said, That when we are in the <i>Cataracui Lake</i>, we are upon the
Level with the <i>French</i>, because here we can meet with all the <i>Indians</i>
that design to go to <i>Monreal</i>. But besides this Passage by the <i>Lakes</i>,
there is a River which comes from the Country of the <i>Sennekas</i>, and
falls into the <i>Onondaga River</i>, by which we have an easy Carriage into
that Country, without going near the <i>Cataracui Lake</i>. The Head of this
River goes near to <i>Lake Erie</i>, and probably may give a very near
Passage into that Lake, much more advantageous than the Way the <i>French</i>
are obliged to take by the great Fall of <i>Jagara</i>, because narrow Rivers
are much safer for Canoes than the Lakes, where they are obliged to go
ashore if there be any Wind upon the Water. But as this Passage depends
upon a further Discovery, I shall say nothing more of it at this time.</p>

<p>Whoever then considers these Advantages <i>New-York</i> has of <i>Canada</i>, in
the first buying of their Goods, and in the safe, speedy, and cheap
Transportation of them from <i>Britain</i> to the <i>Lakes</i>, free of all manner
of Duty or Imposts, will readily agree with me, that the Traders of
<i>New-York</i> may sell their Goods in the <i>Indian Countries</i> at half the
Price the People of <i>Canada</i> can, and reap twice the Profit they do.
This will admit of no Dispute with those that know that Strouds (the
Staple <i>Indian Commodity</i>) this Year are sold for <i>Ten Pounds</i> apiece at
<i>Albany</i>, and at <i>Monreal</i> for <i>Twenty-five Pounds</i>, notwithstanding the
great Quantity of Strouds said to be brought directly into <i>Quebeck</i>
from <i>France</i>, and the great Quantities that have been clandestinely
carried from <i>Albany</i>. It cannot therefore be denied that it is only
necessary for the Traders of <i>New-York</i> to apply themselves heartily to
this Trade, in order to bring it wholly into their own Hands; for in
every thing besides Diligence, Industry, and enduring Fatigues, the
<i>English</i> have much the Advantage of the <i>French</i>. And all the <i>Indians</i>
will certainly buy, where they can, at the cheapest Rate.</p>

<p>It must naturally be objected, <i>That if those things are true, how is it
possible that the Traders of</i> New-York <i>should neglect so considerable
and beneficial Trade for so long time?</i></p>

<p>In answering this Objection, I shall show the Difficulties <i>New-York</i>
has labour'd under, by giving a short History of the Country, so far as
it relates to this Trade. Which Method, I think, can be liable to the
least Objection, and put the whole in the truest Light.</p>

<p>When this Country (the Province of <i>New-York</i>) came first under the
Crown of <i>Great-Britain</i>, our <i>Five Nations</i> of <i>Indians</i> were mortal
Enemies of the <i>French</i> at <i>Canada</i>, and were in a continual War with
them, and all the <i>Nations</i> of <i>Indians</i> round the Lakes; so that then
it was not safe for the <i>English</i> to travel further than the Countries
of the <i>Five Nations</i>; nor would our <i>Indians</i> permit the far <i>Indians</i>
(with whom they had constant War) to pass thro' their Countries to
<i>Albany</i>. Besides, the <i>Five Nations</i> of <i>Indians</i> were at that time so
numerous, (consisting of ten times the Number of fighting Men they now
do) that the Trade with them alone was very considerable for so young
and small a Colony. In the latter End of King <i>Charles</i>'s Reign, when
the <i>Duke of York</i>, and <i>Popish Councils</i> prevail'd, the Governor of
<i>New-York</i> (who was likewise a <i>Papist</i>) had Orders to use all his
Endeavours to make up a Peace between our Nations (the <i>Iroquois</i>) and
the <i>French</i>; and that he should persuade the <i>Five Nations</i> to admit
<i>French Priests</i> among them, in order to civilize them. The Consequence
of which was, that the <i>French</i> thereby obtained a free Commerce upon
the <i>Lakes</i>, and obtain'd leave to build <i>Cataraqui Fort</i> upon the
North-side of <i>Cataracui Lake</i>, and have two Vessels of Force upon the
same Lake. From this Time, during all King <i>James</i>'s Reign, the
<i>French</i>, whenever they had any Differences with our <i>Five Nations</i>,
threaten'd, that the <i>English</i> of <i>New-York</i> would join with them, and
destroy the <i>Five Nations</i>; by which, and the Practices of the <i>French
Priests</i>, our <i>Five Nations</i> became very much alienated in their
Affections from the <i>English</i>, and look'd upon them as a People
depending upon the <i>French</i>. The Consequences of this appeared so
dangerous to Colonel <i>Dungan</i>, the Governor of <i>New-York</i>, (though, as I
have said, a <i>Papist</i>) that he again and again complain'd to his Master
of the ill Offices the <i>French Priests</i> did the <i>English</i> among <i>our
Nations</i>. When the <i>English</i> had thus procur'd a Peace for the <i>French</i>,
they thought they might justly reap some Advantage from it; and it's
hardly to be doubted but that they had Promises of that kind. They were
therefore encouraged to send forty Men, with great Quantities of Goods,
into the <i>Lakes</i>, under the Command of Major <i>M<sup>c</sup>Gregory</i>, to trade with
the far <i>Nations</i>. At this time Mr. <i>Denonville</i>, Governor of <i>Canada</i>,
was gathering together all the Force of <i>Canada</i>, and of the <i>Indians</i>,
(Enemies of the <i>Five Nations</i>) in order to surprize the <i>Five Nations</i>,
and destroy them, at the Time they thought themselves secure by the
Peace so lately made. Major <i>M<sup>c</sup>Gregory</i>, and his Company, were met by a
<i>French</i> Officer on <i>Lake Erie</i>, coming with a great Number of Men to
the general Rendezvous of the <i>French</i>, and he, with all the <i>English</i>,
were made Prisoners. They were used with such Severity as has never been
practis'd between <i>Christian Nations</i> in open War, tho' the two Crowns,
at that time, were not only at Peace, but under the strictest Ties of
mutual Friendship; for the <i>French</i> used these People as Slaves in
building <i>Cataraqui Fort</i>, and a poor <i>Frenchman</i> that had conducted
them, was publickly shot to Death, as if he had brought an Enemy into
their Country. Such was their Apprehensions then of the <i>English</i>
getting any Footing among the <i>Indians</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> Governor surprized a Village of the <i>Five Nations</i>, who, on
the <i>French</i> Faith, liv'd in great Security, but seven or eight Leagues
from the <i>French</i> Fort, and sent these miserable People to the Galleys
in <i>France</i>. He afterwards fell upon the <i>Sennekas</i>, and burnt their
Villages, but without any Advantage to the <i>French</i>, they having lost
more Men than the <i>Indians</i> did. This renew'd the War with greater Fury
than ever, between the <i>French</i> and <i>our Indians</i>. For some time
afterwards, <i>our Indians</i>, in a great Body, fell upon the Island of
<i>Monreal</i>, while Mr. <i>Denonville</i> was in the Town: They burnt and
destroy'd all the Villages and Houses round <i>Monreal</i>, and kill'd some
hundreds of Men, Women, and Children. Afterwards they came into the
open Fields before <i>Monreal</i>, and there defy'd the <i>French</i> Governor,
who did not think it proper to fight them. And when they had done all
the Mischief they could, they retir'd without any Loss.</p>

<p>About this Time the Revolution happen'd in <i>Great-Britain</i>, which was
succeeded by a War between <i>Great-Britain</i> and <i>France</i>. In <i>February</i>,
1689/90, a Party of three hundred Men, consisting of equal Numbers of
<i>French</i> and <i>Indians</i>, surprized <i>Schenechtady</i> in the Night-time, when
the poor People were in their Beds, in the greatest Security, where they
barbarously murdered sixty-three Men, Women, and Children, in cold
Blood, laid the Village in Ashes, and then retir'd, without reaping any
other Advantage besides this cruel Revenge on innocent People, for the
Mischief <i>our Indians</i> had done them. This rais'd a cruel War between
the two Colonies, in which there was much Mischief done, and Blood shed,
without any Advantage to either side.</p>

<p>In Time of this War, the <i>most Christian King's</i> Governor of <i>Canada</i>
was so much provoked, that he thought fit to follow the Example of our
barbarous <i>Indians</i>, and burn his <i>Indian Prisoners</i> alive, in the most
cruel Manner, in sight of all the Inhabitants of <i>Quebeck</i>, and to
deliver up the <i>English Prisoners</i> to the <i>French Indians</i>, who indeed
had more Mercy, for they kill'd none of them.</p>

<p>King <i>William</i>'s Peace put an End to this War; but the Peace lasted so
short a while, that the People of this Province hardly had time to
re-settle their Farms on the Frontiers, which they had deserted in the
Time of the War, much less to adventure trading in the <i>Indian
Countries</i>, so lately the Scene of so much Cruelty. But both Colonies
having now an Abhorrence of the Cruelties of the last War, agreed on a
kind of Neutrality for the <i>Indians</i>, during Queen <i>Anne</i>'s War, in
which Time we lost much ground with our own <i>Indians</i>: For the <i>French</i>
having learn'd, by dear Experience, that it was not possible for them
to conquer <i>our Five Indian Nations</i>, resolv'd to try all Means to gain
their Affections, and in this Art the <i>French</i> are always more
successful than in that of War; and the <i>English</i> failing in two
ill-concerted Expeditions against <i>Canada</i>, the <i>Indians</i> lost much of
the Opinion they had of the <i>English</i> Power and Valour.</p>

<p>In Time of this last War, the clandestine Trade to <i>Monreal</i> began to be
carried on by <i>Indians</i>, from <i>Albany</i> to <i>Monreal</i>. This gave Rise to
the <i>Kahnuaga</i>, or <i>Praying Indians</i>, who are entirely made up of
Deserters from the <i>Mohawks</i> and <i>River Indians</i>, and were either
enticed thither by the <i>French Priests</i>, or by our Merchants, in order
to carry Goods from <i>Albany</i> to <i>Monreal</i>, or run away for some Mischief
done here. These <i>Indians</i> now consist of about eighty fighting Men, and
live about four Leagues above <i>Monreal</i>: They neither plant nor hunt,
but depend chiefly upon this private Trade for their Subsistence. These
<i>Indians</i>, in time of War, gave the <i>French</i> Intelligence of all Designs
here against them: By them likewise the <i>French</i> engaged our <i>Five
Nations</i> in a War with the <i>Indians</i> Friends of <i>Virginia</i>, and from
them we might expect the greatest Mischief in Time of War, seeing every
Part of the Province is as well known to them as to any of the
Inhabitants. But if this Trade was entirely at an end, we have reason to
believe, that these <i>Indians</i> would return to their own Tribes, for they
then could not long subsist where they now are.</p>

<p>As soon as the Peace was proclaim'd, an open Trade with <i>Monreal</i> was
carried on with such Earnestness, that <i>Monreal</i> was fill'd with <i>Indian
Goods</i>, and <i>Albany</i> exhausted; by which means <i>Monreal</i> became the
principal, if not the only <i>Indian Market</i>, and the <i>Indians</i> depended
entirely on the <i>French</i> for what they wanted.</p>

<p>Our Merchants were fond of the <i>Canada</i> Trade, because they sold large
Quantities of Goods without any Trouble, the <i>French</i> taking them from
their Doors; whereas the Trade with the <i>Indians</i> is carried on with a
great deal of Toil and Fatigue; and as to the Interest of the Country,
they either never thought any thing about it, or if they did, had no
regard to it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Now I have brought this Account to the Time your Excellency arriv'd;
what has happen'd since, your Excellency knows better than I can by any
means inform you. From the whole, it seems plain, that any Difficulties
and Disadvantages this Province has been under, have only proceeded from
the Wars, which have continued since the first settling of the Province,
to the beginning of the last general Peace. But now, that not only <i>this
Province</i>, but likewise our <i>six Nations</i> of <i>Indians</i> are at Peace, and
in Amity, both with the <i>French</i>, and all the <i>Indian Nations</i> with whom
we can have any Commerce, these Difficulties are all remov'd, and we now
enjoy the most favourable Time, that at any time can be hoped for, in
order to extend the <i>British Commerce</i> in <i>North-America</i>, while the
<i>French</i> not only labour under the Difficulties which I have shown to be
inseparable from the Situation of their Colony, but likewise under
another Disadvantage, (not before taken notice of) by the Furr-Trade of
<i>Canada</i> being restrain'd to one Company. This Company is obliged to pay
heavy Duties in <i>France</i> upon the Importation of Beaver, or any other
Furr; for which reason they always fix a Price upon Beaver, and their
other Furrs, in <i>Canada</i>; and the <i>Indian Traders</i> of <i>Canada</i> being
restrain'd from selling to any but the Company's Agents there, they
cannot raise the Price of <i>Indian Goods</i> as the Price of <i>European</i>
rise, or as their Profit on the Goods they sell to the <i>Indians</i> is
lessen'd.</p>

<p>The Merchants of <i>New-York</i> allow our <i>Indian</i> Traders double the Price
for Beaver, that the <i>French</i> Company allow their <i>Indian</i> Traders, the
Price established by the Company for Beaver, in <i>Canada</i>, being two
Livres, or <i>eighteen Pence Sterling</i>, the Pound-weight; and the current
Price of Beaver in <i>New-York</i> being <i>five Shillings New-York</i> Money, or
<i>three Shillings Sterling</i> the Pound-weight. Therefore it plainly
follows, that our <i>Indian Traders</i> could under-sell the <i>French
Traders</i>, tho' they were to give as great a Price for <i>European Goods</i>
as the <i>French</i> do, and did transport them at as great Charge, because
of the double Price they have for their Furrs in <i>New-York</i>.</p>

<p>But as our <i>Indian Traders</i> not only have a double Price for their
<i>Indian Goods</i>, but likewise buy the Goods they sell to the <i>Indians</i>,
at half the Price the <i>French Indian Traders</i> do, the <i>French Traders</i>
must be ruin'd by carrying on this Trade, in Competition with the
<i>English</i> of <i>New-York</i>. And the <i>French Indian Traders</i> had been ruin'd
before now, if they had not found means to carry their Beaver to
<i>Albany</i>, where they got double the Price they must have sold for in
<i>Canada</i>.</p>

<p>It may be objected, against this Argument, <i>That the</i> Canada <i>Company as
soon as they find that the Traders cannot sell at their established
Price, will allow a greater Price</i>. But if we consider the Duties the
<i>French Company</i> is obliged to pay to the King, they cannot allow so
great a Price as the <i>English</i> can at <i>New-York</i>. And if it should be
insisted, <i>That the</i> French Company <i>may obtain a Remission of those</i>,
yet if the clandestine Trade with <i>Albany</i> be entirely stopt, the
<i>French Traders</i> will be ruin'd before such Remission can be obtain'd,
and their Trade will be at an end.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>My Inclination led me to show what Advantages not only the <i>Indian
Trade</i> would reap by extending our Frontiers as far as the Lakes, but
likewise the <i>British Trade</i> in some other Branches, which the
Parliament of <i>Great Britain</i> seem to have much at heart, <i>viz. Naval
Stores</i>; for the Soil on both Sides of the <i>Mohawks River</i> being as rich
as it is possible (I believe) for any Land to be, will be found the most
proper for raising of <span class="smcap">Hemp</span>, of any Part of <i>America</i>, and the whole
Country round it being full of the largest Pines, the royal Navy is as
likely to be well provided with <span class="smcap">Masts</span> there, and at as cheap a rate as
any where else. But I have already too far presum'd on your Excellency's
Patience.</p>

<h4>To this it may not be improper to add the following Original Letter.</h4>

<h4><i>From</i> J. A. <i>Esq; to Mr</i>. P. C. <i>of</i> London, <i>shewing the
Success of the Measures taken at that Time</i>.</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 80%;"><i>New-York</i>, 1740.</p>
<div class="blockquot"><i><span class="gesperrt">SIR</span></i>,</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you should be at the Pains to read these printed Papers, it will be a
Pleasure to you to hear of the Success of the Measures taken by Governor
<i>Burnet</i> for redeeming the <i>Indian</i> Trade out of the Hands of the
<i>French</i>. He has succeeded far above our Expectations.</p>

<p>Governor <i>Burnet</i>, through his earnest Application, and at first chiefly
with his Money, Credit, and Risque, erected a Trading-House and
Fortification at the Mouth of the <i>Onondagues</i> River, called <i>Osneigo</i>,
where the Province of <i>New-York</i> supports a Garrison of Soldiers,
consisting of a Lieutenant and twenty Men, which are yearly relieved.</p>

<p>At this Place a very great Trade is carried on with the remote
<i>Indians</i>, who formerly used to go down to the <i>French</i> at <i>Monreal</i>,
and there buy our <i>English</i> Goods, at second Hand, at above twice the
Price they now pay for them at <i>Osneigo</i>; whilst, at the same time, the
<i>French</i> were chiefly supplied by one Gentleman at <i>New-York</i>, who
almost entirely engrossed the <i>Indian</i> Trade of this Province, and
thereby acquired a very great Estate and Influence. But the prudent
Steps taken by our late worthy Governor, to open a free Trade, was the
Cause of the Engrosser's losing his.&mdash;The Probability of doing this, was
the principal Motive of our applying to the King, which is shown by
these printed Papers.</p>

<p>The <i>Indian</i> Trade, to the great Advantage of this Province, is now
divided into several hundred Hands, and there have been for many Years
past upwards of one hundred young Men of this Province, who have gone
yearly among the <i>Indians</i>, to supply them with our Goods.</p>

<p>By this means, at a modest Estimate, I am assured, that the <i>Indian</i>
Trade of this Province is now far above five times as much as when
Governor <i>Burnet</i> began to put his Scheme in execution.</p>

<p>And this is not all the Advantages reaped thereby, but a much more
considerable one to this, and all the other <i>English</i> Colonies is, that
not only our own six Nations, but also many far and remote <i>Indian</i>
Nations are drawn off from their Dependance on the <i>French</i>, and made,
by Trade and Intercourse, dependant on the <i>English</i>; by this means a
great Security and Protection is acquired by the <i>English</i>, in case of a
War with <i>France</i>; and by this Trade our Settlements in this Province
are extended up to the <i>Onondagues</i> Carrying-place, which is now well
attended with Waggons, for the more commodious transporting of Goods to
trade in the Lakes.</p>

<p>And they are now settling on the Branches of <i>Sasquehanah</i> River; and
from the western Branches of this River, there is but a small
Land-Carriage to <i>Allegheny</i>, a Branch of that great River <i>Misissippi</i>;
which Branch extending a thousand Miles from its Mouth, where it enters
the said River; and which joins so near to our Settlements, as is above
taken notice of, opens us a Trade to that vast Country, called by the
<i>French Louisiana</i>, which they possess on the <i>Misissippi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Deputies of the six Nations having, at their last Visit, agreed to
release their Claim to all the Land on both Sides of the River
<i>Sasquehanah</i>, as far South as this Province extends, and to the
Northward to those called the <i>Endless Mountains</i>, or <i>Kittochtinny
Hills</i>; in Consideration whereof, they then received a large Quantity of
valuable <i>Indian</i> Goods for the Lands situate on the Eastern Side of the
said River, but declined at that Time to receive any for those on the
Western Side of the said River, chusing to defer the same till another
Visit; a large Number arrived from these Nations at <i>Philadelphia</i>, on
<i>Wednesday</i> the 30<sup>th</sup> of <i>June</i>, with Deputies duly impowered to
receive the said Goods; and acquainted the Governor, that being weary
from the Fatigue of their long Journey, they should crave three or four
Days to rest themselves before they proceeded to their Business: In the
mean time they would wait on the Governor to discourse, according to
their usual Method, about News and other Occurrences; which the Governor
readily agreed to, and ask'd them when they would chuse to pay their

<p>The Governor opened the Conference as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'The Proprietor having purchased certain Lands from your Nations
about six Years ago, a Moiety of what was agreed to be given in
Consideration of that Purchase was at that Time delivered to
them, and the other being at their Desire left in the
Proprietor's Hands, he pressed you by <i>Shikalamy</i> to send last
Year for it, and would have been glad to have seen you, and
taken you by the Hand before his Departure. But as the Design of
this Meeting is to hear your News, and converse together in a
free and friendly Manner, I shall say no more about the Goods
than that they lie ready at the Proprietor's House, and will be
delivered when you shall have sufficiently rested from the
Fatigue of your Journey.'</p></div>

<p>The Chief of the <i>Onondagoes</i> spoke.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'We propose to rest four Days, and then come to the main
Business. At present we are at a private Conference about News,
and have something of this sort to mention to our Brother
<i>Onas</i>.' And on the Governor's signifying they would be glad to
know what it was, the Chief proceeded.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'It is our Way when we come to our Brethren, or any other
Persons, whom we live in strict Friendship with, to remove all
Obstructions to a good Understanding; with this View we are to
inform you of a Piece of disagreeable News that happen'd in our
Journey.&mdash;&mdash;Some White People living at a Place called
<i>Conegocheegoe</i>, whose Names we cannot tell, nor whether they
belong to this or the neighbouring Government, but one of them,
as we heard, had his House burnt over his Head some Years ago,
and he was brought down a Prisoner and committed to the Goal of
this City: These People lighting of our young Warriors, as they
were hunting, made some Proposals about the Purchasing of Land
from them, and our young Men being indiscreet, and unacquainted
with publick Business, were foolish enough to hearken to them,
and to receive five Duffil Strowds for two Plantations on the
River <i>Cohongoronto</i>. A <i>Conestogoe Indian</i>, and a <i>French
Indian</i>, and some others that were in Company, had three Duffil
Strowds, and went away with them; and our young Men carried off
the other two. As soon as this came to our Knowledge, we sent
for our Warriors, and after examining and rebuking them
severely, we took away their two Strowds, and publickly censured
them for exposing us to our Brethren of <i>Pensylvania</i>, in doing
a Thing so inconsistent with our Engagements to them; "You are,
said we aloud, that all our People might hear and take Notice,
to know and remember, that the Six Nations have obliged
themselves to sell none of the Land that falls within the
Province of <i>Pensylvania</i>, to any other but out Brother <i>Onas</i>,
and that to sell Lands to any other is an high Breach of the
League of Friendship." Brethren, this rash Proceeding of our
young men makes us ashamed. We always mean well, and shall
perform faithfully what we have promised: And we assure you,
this Affair was transacted in the Manner we have related,
without our Privity or Consent. And that you may be fully
convinced of this, and of the Sincerity of our Intentions, we
have brought you these two Strowds [<i>here he presented two red
Strowds to the Governor</i>] they are the very Strowds our foolish
young Men received; we took them from them, and we give them to
you to return to those white People who made the Bargain, and
desire when the Strowds are returned to them, they may be told
what we now say, and that we shall not confirm such Bargains,
nor any other that may interfere with our Engagements to our
Brother <i>Onas</i>.'</p></div>

<p>The Governor then spoke:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'I thank you for this Piece of News; you have taken this Matter
perfectly right. All Bargaining for Land within this Province,
is, to be sure, a manifest Breach of your Contract with the
Proprietors, and what we know you will not countenance. We have
hitherto found the <i>Six Nations</i> faithful to their Engagements,
and this is a fresh Instance of their Punctuality. You could not
help these Mistakes of your young Men; they were not done in
your Presence: But as several Inconveniencies may arise from
these kind of clandestine Sales, or from any such loose Sales of
Land by your People, we desire you will, on your Return home,
give publick Notice to all your Warriors not to bargain for any
Land; or if they do, that you will not confirm such Bargains;
and that this very Affair, together with what you have done
therein, may be particularly reported to all your Nation
assembled in Council.'</p></div>

<p>The <i>Onondago</i> Chief promised to give such publick Notice; and desiring
Liberty to mend his former Speech, he proceeded:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'I forgot one Circumstance: Our People, who pretended to sell
the Land, demanded a Belt of Wampum of the Buyers to carry to
their Chiefs; and on their declaring they had no Wampum, our
Warriors said, they would not answer that their Chiefs would
confirm this Bargain, since they never did any thing of this
Nature without Wampum.'</p></div>

<p>The Governor, after a short Pause, spoke:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span> of the Six Nations</i>,</p>

<p>'I take this Opportunity to relate to you a Piece of
disagreeable News I received some Days ago in a Letter from <i>Le
Tort</i>, the <i>Indian</i> Trader, at <i>Allegheny</i>, who says, "That in
<i>May</i> last some <i>Indians</i> of the <i>Taway</i> Nation, supposed by us
to be the <i>Twightwees</i>, in their Return from War, called and
staid some Time with the <i>Shawanese</i>; who being asked, and
denying they had brought either Scalps or Prisoners, the
<i>Shawanese</i> suspecting them, had the Curiosity to search their
Bags, and finding two Scalps in them, that by the Softness of
the Hair did not feel like <i>Indian</i> Scalps, they wash'd them
clean, and found them to be the Scalps of some Christians. On
this Discovery, the <i>Twightwees</i> were so much ashamed, that they
stole away from their Town in the Night-time; and coming, as
they afterwards understood, to a little Village belonging to
the <i>Shawanese</i>, they told our People that their Hearts were
full of Grief; for, as they came along the Road, they found it
all bloody; and having good Cause to believe it was made bloody
with the Blood of some of the white Brethren, they had very
sorrowfully swept the Road; and desired them to inform the
Governor of <i>Pensilvania</i> of their (the <i>Twightwees</i>) Grief; and
how they had swept the Road clean." '<i>Le Tort</i> adds, on Behalf
of the <i>Shawanese</i>,' "That they were much grieved at this
unfortunate Accident; and prayed, as they had no Concern in it,
more than by being Instruments to discover it, their Brethren
would not blame them, nor suffer a Misunderstanding to arise
between them on this Account: They would sweep the Road clean,
and wipe all the Blood away; and desired their Brethren would be
satisfied with this, and not weep too much for a Misfortune that
might not happen again as long as the Sun and Moon shone."</p>

<p>'The Person who delivered me <i>Le Tort</i>'s Letter, brought this
Bundle of Skins as a Present to me; but I told the Messenger, I
would not meddle with it; he might leave it if he pleased: The
Affair appear'd to me in a bad Light, and I would represent it
to the <i>Six Nations</i>, who were expected in Town every Day. This
is the Fact, as I have it from <i>Le Tort</i>: I desire to be
inform'd if you know any thing of this Matter; and if you do
not, that you will make diligent Enquiry who committed the
Murder, and who are the unhappy Sufferers, and assist us to
obtain Satisfaction, if it shall appear to be any, of our
Fellow-Subjects that have been treated in this Manner.'</p>

<p>
<i>To inforce this Request, I present you with this String of Wampum</i>.<br />
</p></div>

<p>The <i>Onondago</i> Chief, in Reply, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'We take this Information kindly at your Hands; we will take
this String of Wampum home with us to our Lodgings, and there
consult about the most regular and proper Steps to be taken by
us to answer your Expectations, and when we have duly considered
the Matter, we will return you an Answer.'</p></div>

<p>Upon this the Governor put an End to the Conference; and calling for
Wine, and other Liquors, according to the <i>Indian</i> Custom, after a
decent and chearful Entertainment, the <i>Indians</i> withdrew.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<h4>At a <span class="gesperrt">COUNCIL</span> held at the Proprietor's House, <i>July</i> 5, 1742.</h4>

<h4><span class="gesperrt">PRESENT</span></h4>

The Honourable <i><span class="gesperrt">GEORGE THOMAS</span></i>, Esq; Lieutenant-Governor.<br />

<i>James Logan</i>, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />
<i>Clement Plumsted</i>, } Esqrs;

<p>With several Gentlemen of the Town.<br />

<i>The Chiefs of the Six Nations</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>It being judg'd proper, at this critical Time, when we are in daily
Expectation of a <i>French</i> War, to sound the <i>Indians</i>, and discover what
Dependance we might have on them, in case their Aid should be wanted, an
handsome Dinner was provided for their Chiefs; and after they had made
an hearty Meal, and drank his Majesty's Health, the Proprietors, and the
Health of the <i>Six Nations</i>, the Chiefs gave the solemn Cry, in
Testimony of their Thanks for the Honour done them. And soon after the
Governor began, in a free Way, to enquire for what Reason the <i>Senecas</i>
were not come down, since they had an equal Share of the Goods with the
other Nations.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Canassateego</i>, their Speaker, said, 'The <i>Senecas</i>
were in great Distress, on Account of a Famine that raged in their
Country, which had reduced them to such Want, that a Father had been
obliged to kill two of his Children to preserve his own, and the rest of
his Family's Lives; and they could not now come down, but had given
Directions about their Share of the Goods.'&mdash;&mdash;The Governor express'd
his Concern for the unhappy Circumstances of their Brethren of the
<i>Seneca</i> Nation; and, after a short Respite, enquired if any of their
Deputies were then at <i>Canada</i>, and whether the <i>French</i> Governor was
making any warlike Preparations. And on their answering <i>Yes</i>, the
Governor said, with a smiling, pleasant Countenance, 'I suppose, if the
<i>French</i> should go to War with us, you will join them.' The <i>Indians</i>
conferr'd together for some Time, and then <i>Canassateego</i>, in a chearful
lively Manner, made answer.&mdash;&mdash;'We assure you, the Governor of <i>Canada</i>
pays our Nations great Court at this Time, well knowing of what
Consequence we are to the <i>French</i> Interest: He has already told us, he
was uncovering the Hatchet, and sharpening it, and hoped, if he should
be obliged to lift it up against the <i>English</i>, our Nations would remain
neuter, and assist neither Side.&mdash;&mdash;But we will now speak plainly to our
Brethren: Why should we, who are one Flesh with you, refuse to help you,
whenever you want our Assistance?&mdash;&mdash;We have continued a long Time in
the strictest League of Amity and Friendship with you, and we shall
always be faithful and true to you our old and good Allies.&mdash;&mdash;The
Governor of <i>Canada</i> talks a great deal, but ten of his Words do not go
so far as one of yours.&mdash;&mdash;We do not look towards them; we look towards
you; and you may depend on our Assistance.' Whilst the <i>Onondago</i> Chief
made this open and hearty Declaration, all the other <i>Indians</i> made
frequently that particular Kind of Noise which is known to be a Mark of
Approbation.&mdash;&mdash;The Governor bid the Interpreter tell <i>Canassateego</i>,
'He did not set on foot this Enquiry from any Suspicion he had of the
<i>Six Nations</i> wanting a due Regard for the <i>English</i>.&mdash;Our Experience of
their Honour and Faith, said he, would not permit us to think any other
of them, than that they would esteem our Friends their Friends, and our
Enemies their Enemies, agreeable to the strict Union which had ever
subsisted between us.&mdash;As to the Governor of <i>Canada</i>, he told them they
need not mind what he said.&mdash;The <i>English</i>, on equal Terms, had beat the
<i>French</i>, and could beat them again: And were they but to consider the
Advantages which the <i>English</i> have, by possessing so many large and
populous Countries, and so many good Ports on the Continent of
<i>America</i>, they would soon see who had most Reason to fear a War, the
<i>French</i> or the <i>English</i>.'</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Here the Conversation dropped; and after another Glass of Wine, the
<i>Indians</i> resumed the Discourse, by asking whether their Brethren had
not been for some Time engaged in a War with the King of <i>Spain</i>, and
what Successes they had met with.</p>

<p>The Governor told them, the King of <i>Great-Britain</i> lived in an Island,
and being surrounded with the Sea, his chief Strength lay in his Ships;
in which he was so much superior to his Enemies, that they were seldom
to be met with on the broad Ocean, but sculk'd and hid themselves, only
venturing out now and then; and whenever they did, they were almost sure
to be taken; and that the King of <i>Great-Britain</i> had with his Ships,
beat down, or taken several of the <i>Spaniards</i> great Forts in
<i>America</i>.&mdash;The <i>Indians</i> said, they were pleased to hear their Brethren
were an Over-match for their Enemies, and wish'd them good Success.</p>

<p>The Governor then enquired into the State and Condition of the Nations
to the Westward of the Great Lakes, and whether they had any Warriors
then in those Countries? Whether they had concluded Peace with the
Southern <i>Indians</i>? And whether they had heard what their Deputies had
done at <i>Albany</i>?</p>

<p>They made Answer: That they had always Abundance of their Men out
amongst the Nations situate to the West of their Lakes.&mdash;That they had
kindled a Fire with a vast many Nations, some whereof were Tributaries,
and they had a good Understanding with all.&mdash;They set out from their own
Country in Company with two Sets of Deputies, one going to hold a Treaty
with the Southern <i>Indians</i>, and they believed a Peace would be
concluded: The other going to meet the Governor of <i>New-York</i>, at
<i>Albany</i>; but they could not tell what had been done at either
Place.&mdash;On their return, they were to hold a General Council, and would
inform their Brethren of these Particulars.</p>

<p>Then the Governor put an End to the Conference, by telling the <i>Indians</i>
the Goods would be delivered to them at a Council to be held To-morrow
Afternoon at the Meeting-House.</p>

And a great Number of the Inhabitants of <i>Philadelphia</i>.<br />

<p>The Governor having commanded Silence, spoke as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i>Friends and Brethren of the Six Nations</i>,</p>

<p>'Six Years ago a Number of your Chiefs obliged us with a Visit,
when they agreed on Behalf of your Nations, to the Release of
certain Lands on both Sides the River <i>Sasquehannah</i>, to the
Southward of the <i>Endless-Mountains</i>, and within the Limits and
Bounds of the King's Grant of this Province. In Consideration of
which, a certain Quantity of Goods was agreed on, and delivered
as a full Satisfaction for the said Lands, lying on the Eastern
Side of the said River: And for the Lands on the Western Side of
the said River, you desired the Payment should be deferr'd till
another Opportunity. These Goods, which are exactly the same in
Quantity, as those you received the last Time the Chiefs of your
Nations were here, have been ready a considerable Time, and kept
in Expectation of your coming for them: And now you are come
down, fully impowered by your respective Councils to receive
them, we are well pleased to deliver them; leaving it to you to
make a fair and equal Division of them amongst yourselves. We
are sorry for the Absence of our Brethren the <i>Senecas</i>, and
much more so, that it should be owing to their Distress at Home
by a Famine that rages in their Country:&mdash;A Famine so great,
that you tell us a Father has been obliged to sacrifice one Part
of his Family, even his own Children, for the Support and
Preservation of himself, and the other Part.&mdash;We heartily
commiserate their Condition, and do not doubt but you will do
them fair and ample Justice in the Disposal of their Part of the
Goods, in such Manner as they have instructed you. You shall now
hear the List of the Goods read to you.'</p></div>

<p>Here, by the Governor's Order, the List of the Goods was read over,
<i>viz</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">500 <i>Pounds of Powder</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">600 <i>Pounds of Lead</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">45 <i>Guns</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">60 <i>Strowd-Matchcoats</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">100 <i>Blankets</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">100 <i>Duffil Matchcoats</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">200 <i>Yards Half-thick</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">100 <i>Shirts</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">40 <i>Hats</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">40 <i>Pair Shoes &amp; Buckles</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">40 <i>Pair Stockings</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">100 <i>Hatchets</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">500 <i>Knives</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">100 <i>Hoes</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">60 <i>Kettles</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">100 <i>Tobacco-Tongs</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">100 <i>Scissars</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">500 <i>Awl-Blades</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">120 <i>Combs</i>.</span><br />
2000 <i>Needles</i>.<br />
1000 <i>Flints</i>.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">24 <i>Looking-Glasses</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">2 <i>Pounds of Vermilion</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">100 <i>Tin-Pots</i>.</span><br />
1000 <i>Tobacco-Pipes</i>.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">200 <i>Pounds of Tobacco</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">24 <i>Dozen of Gartering</i>, and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">25 <i>Gallons of Rum</i>.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>Then the Governor told them that the Goods, of which the Particulars had
been just read to them, were in the Meeting-House, and would be sent to
whatever Place they would direct.</p>

<p>The Governor then proceeded:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'You have often heard of the Care that your great and good
Friend and Brother <i>William Penn</i>, took at all Times to
cultivate a perfect good Harmony with all the <i>Indians</i>: Of
these your Nations have ever been fully sensible; but more
especially a Number of your Chiefs, about ten Years ago, when on
the Arrival of a Son of your said great Friend <i>William Penn</i>,
large and valuable Presents were exchanged by us with you; a new
Road was made and clear'd; a new Fire kindled; and the Chain of
Friendship made stronger, so as to last while the Sun and Moon
endure.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'And now we cannot but congratulate ourselves, that your coming
should happen at a Time, when we are in daily Expectation of a
War being declared between the King of <i>England</i>, and the
<i>French</i> King, well knowing that should such a War happen, it
must very sensibly affect you, considering your Situation in the
Neighbourhood of <i>Canada</i>. Your coming at this Juncture is
particularly fortunate, since it gives us an Opportunity of
mentioning several Things that may be necessary to be settled,
between People so strictly and closely united as we are.&mdash;An
Union not to be expressed by any Thing less, than the
affectionate Regards which Children of the same Parents bear for
each other, as conceiving ourselves to be one Flesh and one
People.</p>

<p>'The utmost Care therefore ought mutually to be taken by us on
both Sides, that the Road between us be kept perfectly clear and
open, and no Lets nor the least Obstruction be suffered to lie
in the Way; or if any should by Accident be found, that may
hinder our free Intercourse and Correspondence, it must
forthwith be removed.</p></div>

<p><i>To inforce this, we lay down a String of Wampum.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'In the next Place, we, on our Part, shall inlarge our Fire that
burns between us. We shall provide more Fewel to increase it,
and make it burn brighter and clearer, and give a stronger and
more lasting Light and Warmth.</p></div>

<p><i>In Evidence of our sincere Intentions, we lay down this Belt of
Wampum</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'In the last Place, considering the Obligations we are mutually
under by our several Treaties, "That we should hear with our
Ears for you, and you hear with your Ears for us." We shall at
Times very willingly give you the earliest and best
Intelligence, of any Designs that may be form'd to your
Disadvantage.&mdash;And if you discover any Preparations that can
hurt us, we desire you will immediately dispatch some suitable
Person in whom we can place a Confidence, to give us a proper
Information.'</p></div>

<p><i>To inforce this Request, as well as to brighten the Chain, we lay down
this other Belt of Wampum.</i></p>

<p>On the Governor's concluding the Speech, the solemn Cry by Way of
Approbation was repeated by the <i>Indians</i>, as many Times as there were
Nations present; and then <i>Canassateego</i> rose up and spoke.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'We thank you for your kind Speech: What you have said is very
agreeable to us; and To-morrow when we have deliberated on the
several Matters recommended to us, we will give you our Answer.
We desire, as our Time will be wholly taken up in Council, you
will order the Goods to be carried back to the Proprietaries to
prevent their being lost, and that they may continue there till
we call for them.'</p></div>

<p><i><span class="gesperrt">CANASSATEEGO</span></i>'s Speech on Behalf of the <i>Six Nations</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span>, the Governor and Council, and all present</i>,</p>

<p>'According to our Promise we now propose to return you an Answer
to the several Things mentioned to us Yesterday, and shall beg
Leave to speak to publick Affairs first, tho' they were what you
spoke to last. On this Head you Yesterday put us in Mind, first,
"Of <i>William Penn</i>'s early and constant Care to cultivate
Friendship with all the <i>Indians</i>; of the Treaty we held with
one of his Sons, about ten Years ago; and of the Necessity there
is at this Time of keeping the Roads between us clear and free
from all Obstructions." We are all very sensible of the kind
Regard that good Man <i>William Penn</i> had for all the <i>Indians</i>,
and cannot but be pleased to find that his Children have the
same. We well remember the Treaty you mention held with his Son
on his Arrival here, by which we confirmed our League of
Friendship, that is to last as long as the Sun and Moon endure:
In Consequence of this, we, on our Part, shall preserve the Road
free from all Incumbrances; in Confirmation whereof we lay down
this String of Wampum.</p>

<p>'You in the next Place said you would enlarge the Fire and make
it burn brighter, which we are pleased to hear you mention; and
assure you, we shall do the same, by adding to it more Fewel,
that it may still flame out more strongly than ever: In the last
Place, you were pleased to say that we are bound by the
strictest Leagues, to watch for each others Preservation; that
we should hear with our Ears for you, and you hear with your
Ears for us: This is equally agreeable to us; and we shall not
fail to give you early Intelligence, whenever any Thing of
Consequence comes to our Knowledge: And to encourage you to do
the same, and to nourish in your Hearts what you have spoke to
us with your Tongues, about the Renewal of our Amity and the
Brightening of the Chain of Friendship; we confirm what we have
said with another Belt of Wampum.'</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'We received from the Proprietors Yesterday, some Goods in
Consideration of our Release of the Lands on the West-side of
<i>Sasquehannah</i>. It is true, we have the full Quantity according
to Agreement; but if the Proprietor had been here himself, we
think, in Regard of our Numbers and Poverty, he would have made
an Addition to them.&mdash;If the Goods were only to be divided
amongst the <i>Indians</i> present, a single Person would have but a
small Portion; but if you consider what Numbers are left behind,
equally entitled with us to a Share, there will be extremely
little. We therefore desire, if you have the Keys of the
Proprietor's Chest, you will open it, and take out a little more
for us.</p>

<p>'We know our Lands are now become more valuable: The white
People think we do not know their Value; but we are sensible
that the Land is everlasting, and the few Goods we receive for
it are soon worn out and gone. For the future, we will sell no
Lands but when Brother <i>Onas</i> is in the Country; and we will
know beforehand, the Quantity of the Goods we are to receive.
Besides, we are not well used with respect to the Lands still
unsold by us. Your People daily settle on these Lands, and spoil
our Hunting.&mdash;We must insist on your removing them, as you know
they have no Right to settle to the Northward of
<i>Kittochtinny-Hills</i>.&mdash;In particular, we renew our Complaints
against some People who are settled at <i>Juniata</i>, a Branch of
<i>Sasquahannah</i>, and all along the Banks of that River, as far as
<i>Mahaniay</i>; and desire they may be forthwith made to go off the
Land, for they do great Damage to our Cousins the <i>Delawares</i>.</p>

<p>'We have further to observe, with respect to the Lands lying on
the West-side of <i>Sasquahannah</i>, that though Brother <i>Onas</i>
(meaning the Proprietor) has paid us for what his People
possess, yet some Parts of that Country have been taken up by
Persons, whose Place of Residence is to the South of this
Province, from whom we have never received any Consideration.
This Affair was recommended to you by our Chiefs at our last
Treaty; and you then, at our earnest Desire, promised to write a
Letter to that Person who has the Authority over those People,
and to procure us his Answer: As we have never heard from you on
this Head, we want to know what you have done in it. If you have
not done any Thing, we now renew our Request, and desire you
will inform the Person whose People are seated on our Lands,
that that Country belongs to us, in Right of Conquest; we having
bought it with our Blood, and taken it from our Enemies in fair
War; and we expect, as Owners of that Land, to receive such a
Consideration for it as the Land is worth. We desire you will
press him to send a positive Answer: Let him say <i>Yes</i> or <i>No</i>:
If he says Yes, we will treat with him; if No, we are able to do
ourselves Justice; and we will do it, by going to take Payment
ourselves.</p>

<p>'It is customary with us to make a Present of Skins, whenever we
renew our Treaties. We are ashamed to offer our Brethren so few,
but your Horses and Cows have eat the Grass our Deer used to
feed on. This has made them scarce, and will, we hope, plead in
Excuse for our not bringing a larger Quantity. If we could have
spared more, we would have given more; but we are really poor;
and desire you'll not consider the Quantity, but few as they
are, accept them in Testimony of our Regard.'</p></div>

<p><i>Here they gave the Governor a Bundle of Skins</i>.</p>

<p>The Governor immediately replied.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'We thank you for the many Declarations of Respect you have
given us, in this solemn Renewal of our Treaties: We receive,
and shall keep your String and Belts of Wampum, as Pledges of
your Sincerity, and desire those we gave you may be carefully
preserved, as Testimonies of ours.</p>

<p>'In Answer to what you say about the Proprietaries.&mdash;They are
all absent, and have taken the Keys of their Chest with them; so
that we cannot, on their Behalf, enlarge the Quantity of Goods:
Were they here, they might perhaps, be more generous; but we
cannot be liberal for them.&mdash;The Government will, however, take
your Request into Consideration; and in Regard to your Poverty,
may perhaps make you a Present. I but just mention this now,
intending to refer this Part of your Speech to be answered at
our next Meeting.</p>

<p>'The Number of Guns, as well as every Thing else, answers
exactly with the Particulars specified in your Deed of
Conveyance, which is more than was agreed to be given you. It
was your own Sentiments, that the Lands on the West-side of
<i>Sasquahannah</i>, were not so valuable as those on the East; and
an Abatement was to be made, proportionable to the Difference in
Value: But the Proprietor overlooked this, and ordered the full
Quantity to be delivered, which you will look on as a Favour.</p>

<p>'It is very true, that Lands are of late become more valuable;
but what raises their Value? Is it not entirely owing to the
Industry and Labour used by the white People, in their
Cultivation and Improvement? Had not they come amongst you,
these Lands would have been of no Use to you, any further than
to maintain you. And is there not, now you have sold so much,
enough left for all the Purposes of Living?&mdash;What you say of the
Goods, that they are soon worn out, is applicable to every
Thing; but you know very well, that they cost a great deal of
Money; and the Value of Land is no more, than it is worth in
Money.</p>

<p>'On your former Complaints against People's settling the Lands
on <i>Juniata</i>, and from thence all along on the River
<i>Sasquahannah</i> as far as <i>Mahaniahy</i>, some Magistrates were sent
expresly to remove them, and we thought no Persons would presume
to stay after that.'</p></div>

<p>Here they interrupted the Governor, and said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"These Persons who were sent did not do their Duty: So far from
removing the People, they made Surveys for themselves, and they
are in League with the Trespassers. We desire more effectual
Methods may be used, and honester Persons employed."</p></div>

<p>Which the Governor promised, and then proceeded:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'According to the Promise made at our last Treaty with you, Mr.
<i>Logan</i>, who was at that Time President, did write to the
Governor of <i>Maryland</i>, that he might make you Satisfaction for
such of your Lands as his People had taken up, but did not
receive one Word from him upon that Head. I will write to him
again, and endeavour to procure you a satisfactory Answer. We do
not doubt but he will do you Justice: But we exhort you to be
careful not to exercise any Acts of Violence towards his People,
as they likewise are our Brethren, and Subjects of the same
great King; and therefore Violence towards them, must be
productive of very evil Consequences.</p>

<p>'I shall conclude what I have to say at this Time, with
Acknowledgments for your Present; which is very agreeable to us,
from the Expressions of Regard used by you in presenting it:
Gifts of this Nature receiving their Value from the Affection of
the Giver, and not from the Quantity or Price of the Thing
given.'</p></div>

<p>The Board taking into Consideration, whether it be proper or not at this

in Return for their Present to this Government at Yesterday's Treaty;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Resolved</i>,</span><br />
</p>

<p>That it is highly fit and proper that a Present be made to the said
<i>Indians</i> at this Time.</p>

<p>And it is the Opinion of this Board, that the said Present should be of
the Value of 500 <i>l.</i> or at least 300 <i>l.</i></p>

<p>And it is recommended to Mr. <i>Logan</i>, Mr. <i>Preston</i>, and Mr. <i>Lawrence</i>,
to acquaint Mr. <i>Kinsey</i>, the Speaker of the Assembly, with the Opinion
of this Board; and that they request him to confer with such other
Members of Assembly as are in Town, and report their Sentiments
thereupon.</p>

<p>The Board taking into Consideration the Threats expressed by the
<i>Indians</i>, at the Treaty Yesterday, against the Inhabitants of
<i>Maryland</i>, settled on certain Lands on the West-side of <i>Sasquahannah</i>,
which the <i>Indians</i> claim, and for which they require Satisfaction; and
considering, that should those Threats, in any Sort be put in Execution,
not only the Inhabitants of <i>Maryland</i>, but of this Government, and all
his Majesty's Subjects on the Northern Continent of <i>America</i>, may
thereby be involved in much Trouble: It is the Opinion of this Board,
that the Governor write to the Governor of <i>Maryland</i> without Delay, to
inform him of the <i>Indians</i> Complaints and Threats, and to request a
satisfactory Answer; and that his Letter be sent by a special Messenger,
at the publick Expence.</p>

Mr. <i>Peters</i>.<br />

<p>The Governor informed the Board, that the <i>Indian</i> Chiefs dining with
him Yesterday, after Dinner delivered their Answer to two Affairs of
Consequence:</p>

<p>The first related to the violent Battery committed on <i>William Webb</i>, in
the Forks of <i>Delaware</i>, whereby his Jaw-bone was broke, and his Life
greatly endangered, by an unknown <i>Indian</i>. <i>Canassatego</i> repeating the
Message delivered to the <i>Six Nations</i> by <i>Shickcalamy</i>, in the Year
1740, with a String of Wampum, said in Answer: 'The <i>Six Nations</i> had
made diligent Enquiry into the Affair, and had found out the <i>Indian</i>
who had committed the Fact; he lived near <i>Asopus</i>, and had been
examined and severely reprov'd: And they hoped, as <i>William Webb</i> was
recovered, the Governor would not expect any further Punishment; and
therefore they returned the String of Wampum received from their
Brethren, by the Hand of <i>Shickcalamy</i>, in Token that they had fully
complied with their Request.'</p>

<p>I thank'd them, said he, for their Care; but reminded them, that though
the Man did not die, yet he lay a long Time in extreme Misery, and would
never recover the free Use of his Speech, and was rendered less able to
get his Livelihood; and in such Cases the <i>English</i> Laws obliged the
Assailant to make good all Damages, besides paying for the Pain
endured.&mdash;But as the <i>Indian</i> was, in all Probability, poor and unable
to make Satisfaction, I told them, that for their Sake I would forgive
him; adding, had <i>Webb</i> died, I make no Doubt but you would have put the
<i>Indian</i> to Death, just as we did two of our People who had killed an
<i>Indian</i>; we caused them to be hung on a Gallows, in the Presence of
many Hundreds of our People, to deter all others from doing the like.
<i>Canassatego</i> made me this Reply: 'The <i>Indians</i> know no Punishment but
Death; they have no such Thing as pecuniary Mulcts; if a Man be guilty
of a Crime, he is either put to Death, or the Fault is overlook'd. We
have often heard of your Hanging-up those two Persons; but as none of
our <i>Indians</i> saw the Men die, many believe they were not hanged, but
transported to some other Colony: And it would be satisfactory to the
<i>Indians</i>, if, for the future, some of them be sent for, to be Witnesses
of such Executions.' I assured them, that whoever gave them that
Information, abused them; for the Persons certainly suffered Death, and
in the Presence of all the People.</p>

<p><i>Canassatego</i> then proceeded to give an Answer to what was said to them
the 2d Instant, relating to <i>Le Tort</i>'s Letter: 'That they had, in
Council, considered in what Manner the Matter recommended to them ought
to be conducted; and they were of Opinion, that as the <i>Shawanese</i>, not
the <i>Twightwys</i> (for they knew so much of it, that the People were of
the <i>Twightwy</i> Nation in whose Bags the Scalps were found) had sent me a
Present of Skins, I should in return, send them a Blanket or a Kettle,
and with it a very sharp Message, that tho' they had done well in
sweeping the Road from Blood, yet that was but a small Part of their
Duty; they ought not to have suffered the <i>Twightwys</i>, after their Lye
and the Discovery of the Scalps, to have left them, 'till they had given
a full and true Account how they came by them, whose Scalps they were,
and in what Place, and for what Reason the Men were kill'd; and when
they had been fully satisfied of all these Particulars, then it was
their Duty to have given Information to the Government where the white
People lived, that the Murderers might be complained against, and
punished by the Nation they belonged to: And as the <i>Shawanese</i> had
omitted to perform the Part of Brethren, that I should reprove them for
it, and charge them to make Amends for their Neglect, by using all
possible Expedition to come at the Knowledge of these Things, and to aid
their Brethren the white People in obtaining Justice.'</p>

<p>The Minutes of the preceding Council being read, Mr. <i>Logan</i>, in
pursuance of the Board's Direction of Yesterday, reported, on behalf of
himself, and the other Gentlemen to whom it was recommended, that they
had confer'd with Mr. <i>Kinsey</i>, and requested him to consult the other
Members of the Assembly concerning the making a Present to the
<i>Indians</i>; and that Mr. <i>Kinsey</i> having collected the Sentiments of
several Members of the Assembly in Town, whom he had confer'd with on
that Subject, found them generally of Opinion, that a Present should at
this Time be made; but that they had declined nominating any Sum:
However, that Mr. <i>Kinsey</i> had given it as his own Opinion, that the
Governor and Council might go as far as <i>three hundred Pounds</i>.</p>

<p>And accordingly it is refer'd to Mr. <i>Logan</i>, Mr. <i>Preston</i>, and Mr.
<i>Lawrence</i>, to consider of, and prepare a proper List of the Goods
whereof the Present should be composed, to the Value of <i>three hundred
Pounds</i>, as aforesaid; advising with the Interpreter as to the Quantity
and Quality.</p>

<p>The Governor spoke to the Chiefs of the <i>Six Nations</i>, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'The last Time the Chiefs of the <i>Six Nations</i> were here, they
were informed, that your Cousins, a Branch of the <i>Delawares</i>,
gave this Province some Disturbance about the Lands the
Proprietor purchased from them, and for which their Ancestors
had received a valuable Consideration above <i>fifty-five</i> Years
ago, as appears by a Deed now lying on the Table.&mdash;Sometime
after this, <i>Conrad Weiser</i> delivered to your Brother <i>Thomas
Penn</i> your Letter, wherein you request of him, and <i>James
Logan</i>, that they would not buy Land, &amp;c.&mdash;This has been shewn
to them and interpreted; notwithstanding which they have
continued their former Disturbances, and have had the Insolence
to write Letters to some of the Magistrates of this Government,
wherein they have abused your good Brethren, our worthy
Proprietaries, and treated them with the utmost Rudeness and
Ill-Manners. Being loth, from our Regard to you, to punish them
as they deserve, I sent two Messengers to inform them that you
were expected here, and should be acquainted with their
Behaviour.&mdash;As you, on all Occasions, apply to us to remove all
white People that are settled on Lands before they are purchased
from you, and we do our Endeavours to turn such People off; we
now expect from you, that you will cause these <i>Indians</i> to
remove from the Lands in the Forks of Delaware, and not give any
further Disturbance to the Persons who are now in Possession.'</p></div>

<p><i>To inforce this we lay down a String of Wampum</i>.</p>

<p>Then were read the several Conveyances, the Paragraph of the Letter
wrote by the Chiefs of the <i>Six Nations</i> relating to the <i>Delawares</i>;
the Letters of the <i>Fork-Indians</i> to the Governor and Mr. <i>Langhorne</i>,
and a Draught of the Land; these were then delivered to <i>Conrad Weiser</i>,
who was desired to interpret them to the Chiefs, when they should take
this Affair into their Consideration.</p>

<p>The Governor spoke to the <i>Indians</i> as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'This Meeting will be short: It is in order to make you a
Present from the Governor, the Council, the Assembly, and all
our People. <i>William Penn</i> was known to you to be a good and
faithful Friend to all the <i>Indians</i>: He made a League of
Friendship with you, by which we became one People. This League
has often since been renew'd by friendly Treaties; and as you
have declared that the Friendship shall always last on your
Parts, so we would have you believe that it shall remain
inviolable on ours while the Sun and Moon endure.</p>

<p>'I gave you some Expectation of a Present, and we have it now
ready to deliver to you. This Present is made you by the
Governor, Council, Assembly, and all our People, in
Consideration of the great Miseries and Distresses which you our
good Friends have lately suffered. This will be some Relief to
you for the present, and it's to be hoped your own Industry will
soon retrieve your Circumstances.</p>

<p>'It has sometimes happened, and may happen again, that idle and
untrue Stories are carried to you concerning us your Brethren;
but our Desire is, and we expect it from you, that you will give
no Credit to them; for we are, and always will be, your steady
and sincere Friends.</p>

<p>'It is a Custom when we renew our Treaties with our good Friends
the <i>Indians</i>, to clear the Road, and make our Fire burn bright:
We have done so upon this Occasion; and, in Token of our
Sincerity, we deliver you, as a Present from the Governor, the
Council, the Assembly, and all the People of <i>Pensylvania</i>, the
following Goods, <i>viz</i>.</p></div>

<p>Whereupon the Chiefs, and all the <i>Indians</i>, returned their solemn
Thanks; and <i>Canassatego</i> said, 'They had no more to say as to publick

<i><span class="gesperrt">CANASSATEGO</span></i> said:<br />

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span>, the Governor and Council</i>,</p>

<p>'The other Day you informed us of the Misbehaviour of our
Cousins the <i>Delawares</i>, with respect to their continuing to
claim, and refusing to remove from some Land on the River
<i>Delaware</i>, notwithstanding their Ancestors had sold it by a
Deed under their Hands and Seals to the Proprietaries, for a
valuable Consideration, upwards of <i>fifty</i> Years ago; and
notwithstanding that, they themselves had also not many Years
ago, after a long and full Examination, ratified that Deed of
their Ancestors, and given a fresh one under their Hands and
Seals; and then you requested us to remove them, inforcing your
Request with a String of Wampum.&mdash;Afterwards we laid on the
Table our own Letters by <i>Conrad Weiser</i>; some of our Cousins
Letters, and the several Writings to prove the Charge against
our Cousins, with a Draught of the Land in Dispute.&mdash;We now tell
you, we have perused all these several Papers: We see with our
own Eyes, that they have been a very unruly People, and are
altogether in the Wrong in their Dealings with you.&mdash;We have
concluded to remove them, and oblige them to go over the River
<i>Delaware</i>, and quit all Claim to any Lands on this Side for the
future, since they have received Pay for them, and it is gone
thro' their Guts long ago.&mdash;To confirm to you that we will see
your Request executed, we lay down this String of Wampum in
return for yours.'</p></div>

<p>Then turning to the <i>Delawares</i>, holding a Belt of Wampum in his Hand,
he spoke to them as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">COUSINS</span></i>,</p>

<p>'Let this Belt of Wampum serve to chastise you. You ought to be
taken by the Hair of the Head and shaked severely, till you
recover your Senses and become sober. You don't know what Ground
you stand on, nor what you are doing. Our Brother <i>Onas</i>'s Cause
is very just and plain, and his Intentions are to preserve
Friendship. On the other Hand, your Cause is bad; your Heart far
from being upright; and you are maliciously bent to break the
Chain of Friendship with our Brother <i>Onas</i>, and his People. We
have seen with our Eyes a Deed sign'd by nine of your Ancestors
above <i>fifty</i> Years ago for this very Land, and a Release
sign'd, not many Years since, by some of yourselves and Chiefs
now living, to the Number of fifteen or upwards.&mdash;But how came
you to take upon you to sell Land at all? We conquered you; we
made Women of you; you know you are Women, and can no more sell
Land than Women; nor is it fit you should have the Power of
selling Lands, since you would abuse it. This Land that you
claim is gone thro' your Guts; you have been furnished with
Cloaths, Meat, and Drink, by the Goods paid you for it, and now
you want it again, like Children as you are.&mdash;But what makes you
sell Land in the Dark? Did you ever tell us that you had sold
this Land? Did we ever receive any Part, even the Value of a
Pipe-Shank, from you for it? You have told us a blind Story,
that you sent a Messenger to us to inform us of the Sale, but he
never came amongst us, nor we never heard any thing about
it.&mdash;This is acting in the Dark, and very different from the
Conduct our <i>Six</i> Nations observe in the Sales of Land; on such
Occasions they give publick Notice, and invite all the <i>Indians</i>
of their united Nations, and give them all a Share of the
Present they receive for their Lands.&mdash;This is the Behaviour of
the wise united Nations.&mdash;But we find you are none of our Blood:
You act a dishonest Part, not only in this, but in other
Matters: Your Ears are ever open to slanderous Reports about our
Brethren; you receive them with as much Greediness as lewd Women
receive the Embraces of bad Men. And for all these Reasons we
charge you to remove instantly; we don't give you the Liberty to
think about it. You are Women. Take the Advice of a wise Man,
and remove immediately. You may return to the other Side of
<i>Delaware</i> where you came from: But we do not know whether,
considering how you have demean'd yourselves, you will be
permitted to live there; or whether you have not swallowed that
Land down your Throats as well as the Land on this Side. We
therefore assign you two Places to go, either to <i>Wyomen</i> or
<i>Shamokin</i>. You may go to either of these Places, and then we
shall have you more under our Eye, and shall see how you behave.
Don't deliberate; but remove away, and take this Belt of
Wampum.'</p></div>

<p>This being interpreted by <i>Conrad Weiser</i> into <i>English</i>, and by
<i>Cornelius Spring</i> into the <i>Delaware</i> Language, <i>Canassatego</i> taking a
String of Wampum, added further.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'After our just Reproof, and absolute Order to depart from the
Land, you are now to take Notice of what we have further to say
to you. This String of Wampum serves to forbid you, your
Children and Grand-Children, to the latest Posterity for ever,
meddling in Land-Affairs; neither you, nor any who shall descend
from you, are ever hereafter to presume to sell any Land: For
which purpose, you are to preserve this String, in Memory of
what your Uncles have this Day given you in Charge.&mdash;We have
some other Business to transact with our Brethren, and therefore
depart the Council, and consider what has been said to you.'</p></div>

<p><i>Canassatego</i> then spoke to the Governor and Council:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'We called at our old Friend <i>James Logan</i>'s, in our Way to this
City, and to our Grief we found him hid in the Bushes, and
retired, thro' Infirmities, from publick Business. We press'd
him to leave his Retirement, and prevailed with him to assist
once more on our Account at your Councils. We hope,
notwithstanding his Age, and the Effects of a Fit of Sickness,
which we understand has hurt his Constitution, that he may yet
continue a long Time to assist this Province with his Counsels.
He is a wise Man, and a fast Friend to the <i>Indians</i>. And we
desire, when his Soul goes to <span class="gesperrt">GOD</span>, you may chuse in his Room
just such another Person, of the same Prudence and Ability in
counselling, and of the same tender Disposition and Affection
for the <i>Indians</i>. In Testimony of our Gratitude for all his
Services, and because he was so good as to leave his
Country-House, and follow us to Town, and be at the Trouble, in
this his advanced Age, to attend the Council, we present him
with this Bundle of Skins.'</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'It is always our Way, at the Conclusion of a Treaty, to desire
you will use your Endeavours with the Traders, that they may
sell their Goods cheaper, and give us a better Price for our
Deer-Skins. Whenever any particular Sort of <i>Indian</i> Goods is
scarce, they constantly make us pay the dearer on that Account.
We must now use the same Argument with them: Our Deer are killed
in such Quantities, and our Hunting-Countries grown less every
Day by the Settlement of white People, that Game is now
difficult to find, and we must go a great Way in quest of it;
they therefore ought to give us a better Price for our Skins;
and we desire you would speak to them to do so. We have been
stinted in the Article of Rum in Town. We desire you will open
the Rum-Bottle, and give it to us in greater Abundance on the
Road.'</p></div>

<p>
<i>To inforce our Request, about the</i> Indian <i>Traders</i>, <i>we present you
with this Bundle of Skins</i>.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'When we first came to your Houses, we found them clean and in
Order; but we have staid so long as to dirty them; which is to
be imputed to our different Way of Living from the white People:
And therefore, as we cannot but have been disagreeable to you on
this Account, we present you with some Skins to make your Houses
clean, and put them into the same Condition they were in when we
came amongst you.'</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'The Business the <i>Five</i> Nations transact with you is of great
Consequence, and requires a skilful and honest Person to go
between us; one in whom both you and we can place a
Confidence.&mdash;We esteem our present Interpreter to be such a
Person, equally faithful in the Interpretation of whatever is
said to him by either of us, equally allied to both; he is of
our Nation, and a Member of our Council, as well as of yours.
When we adopted him, we divided him into two equal Parts: One we
kept for ourselves, and one we left for you. He has had a great
deal of trouble with us, wore out his Shoes in our Messages, and
dirty'd his Clothes by being amongst us, so that he is become as
nasty as an <i>Indian</i>.</p>

<p>'In Return for these Services, we recommend him to your
Generosity; and on our own Behalf, we give him <i>Five Skins</i> to
buy him Clothes and Shoes with.'</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span></i>,</p>

<p>'We have still one more Favour to ask. Our Treaty, and all we
have to say about publick Business, is now over, and to-morrow
we design to leave you. We hope, as you have given us Plenty of
good Provision whilst in Town, that you will continue your
Goodness so far as to supply us with a little more to serve us
on the Road. And we likewise desire you will provide us with
Waggons, to carry our Goods to the Place where they are to be
conveyed by Water.'</p></div>

<p>To these several Points the Governor made the following Reply.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<i><span class="gesperrt">BRETHREN</span> of the Six Nations</i>,</p>

<p>'The Judgment you have just now pass'd on your Cousins the
<i>Delawares</i>, confirms the high Opinion we have ever entertained
of the Justice of the <i>Six Nations</i>. This Part of your
Character, for which you are deservedly famed, made us wave
doing ourselves Justice, in order to give you another
Opportunity of convincing the World of your inviolable
Attachment to your Engagements. These unhappy People might have
always liv'd easy, having never receiv'd the least Injury from
us; but we believe some of our own People were bad enough to
impose on their Credulity, and engage them in these wrong
Measures, which we wish, for their Sakes, they had avoided.</p>

<p>'We hoped, from what we have constantly given in Charge to the
<i>Indian</i> Traders, that they would have administred no just Cause
of Complaint: If they do you Wrong, it is against our
Inclinations, and contrary to our express Directions. As you
have exhibited no particular Charge against them, we shall use
our best Endeavours to persuade them to give you as much for
your Skins as they can possibly afford; and to take Care that
their Goods which they give in Exchange for Skins, be of the
best Sort. We will likewise order you some Rum to serve you on
your journey home, since you desire it.</p>

<p>'We wish there had been more Room and better Houses provided for
your Entertainment; but not expecting so many of you, we did the
best we could. 'Tis true, there are a great many Houses in
Town, but as they are the Property of other People, who have
their own Families to take care of, it is difficult to procure
Lodgings for a large Number of People, especially if they come
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>'We entertain the same Sentiments of the Abilities and Probity
of the Interpreter as you have express'd. We were induc'd at
first to make use of him in this important Trust, from his being
known to be agreeable to you, and one who had lived amongst you
for some Years, in good Credit and Esteem with all your Nations;
and have ever found him equally faithful to both. We are pleas'd
with the Notice you have taken of him, and think he richly
deserves it at your Hands. We shall not be wanting to make him a
suitable Gratification, for the many good and faithful Services
he hath done this Government.</p>

<p>'We have already given Orders for Waggons to carry your Goods,
and for a Supply of Provisions to serve you on the Road in your
Return home, where we heartily wish you may arrive in good
Health.'</p></div>

<p>After the Governor had concluded, Mr. <i>Logan</i> return'd an Answer to that
Part of <i>Canassatego</i>'s Speech which related to him, and said, 'That not
only upon the Account of his Lameness, of which the <i>Indians</i> themselves
were Witnesses; but on Account of another Indisposition, which about
three Years since had laid him under an Incapacity of expressing himself
with his former usual Freedom, he had been obliged to live retired in
the Country. But that our first Proprietor, the Honourable <i>William
Penn</i>, who had ever been a Father and true Friend to all the <i>Indians</i>,
having above forty Years since recommended them to his particular Care,
he had always, from his own Inclination, as well as from that strict
Charge, endeavoured to convince all the <i>Indians</i>, that he was their
true Friend; and was now well pleased, that after a Tract of so many
Years, they were not insensible of it. He thanked them kindly for their
Present, and heartily joined with them in their Desires, that this
Government may always be furnished with Persons of equally good
Inclinations, and not only with such, but also with better Abilities to
serve them.'</p>

<p>And then <i>Canassatego</i> said, he had forgot to mention, that
<i>Shickcalamy</i> and <i>Caxhayn</i> had been employ'd on several Messages to
this Government, and desir'd they might be consider'd on that Account.</p>

<p>The Board taking into Consideration the Regulation of the necessary
Expences of the <i>Indians</i> travelling down hither, and returning; and
upon an Estimate made by <i>Conrad Weiser</i>, amounting to about <i>one
hundred Pounds</i>, it appearing that the said Sum of 100 <i>l.</i> will be
necessary to be advanced to <i>Conrad Weiser</i> to defray those Expences,
Mr. <i>Logan</i>, on the Proprietaries Behalf, proposes to advance 40 <i>l.</i>
and the Treasurer declaring he had no publick Money in his Hands, and
that if he had, he would not advance Money without the Assembly's Order;
it is recommended to Mr. <i>Preston</i> and Mr. <i>Lawrence</i>, to confer with
Mr. <i>Kinsey</i>, and know whether he, as Speaker of the Assembly, and
Trustee of the Loan-Office, will advance the other 60 <i>l.</i></p>

<p>And the <i>Indians</i> having requested that they might have a small Quantity
of Rum, to be added to their Provisions, to comfort them on the Road:
The Board is of Opinion, that there be added to the said Estimate
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for twenty Gallons of Rum for the aforesaid Use. And in
Return for their Present of Skins, at requesting that the <i>Indian</i>
Traders be enjoin'd to sell their Goods cheaper, the Board directs that
two Strouds be presented. And that <i>five Pounds</i> be given to <i>Caxhayn</i>
on the Account of the Province, for his Services; and to <i>Shickcalamy</i>
the like Sum.</p>

<p>The Governor and the Commissioners took some of the <i>Indian</i> Chiefs by

welcome into the Government; and there being Wine and Punch prepared for
them, the Governor and the several Commissioners drank Health to the
<i>Six Nations</i>; and <i>Canassatego, Tachanoontia</i>, and some other Chiefs,
returned the Compliments, drinking the Healths of <i>Onas</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>,

<p>After they were all served with Wine, Punch, Pipes and Tobacco, the
Governor told the <i>Indians</i>, that as it was customary, and indeed
necessary, they should have some Time to rest after so long a Journey,
and as he thought three Days would be no more than sufficient for that
Purpose, he proposed to speak to them on <i>Monday</i> next; after which, the
honourable Commissioners would take their own Time to deliver what they
had to say.</p>

<p><i><span class="gesperrt">CANASSATEGO</span></i> answered the Governor: We thank you for giving us Time to
rest; we are come to you, and shall leave it intirely to you to appoint
the Time when we shall meet you again. We likewise leave it to the
Governor of <i>Maryland</i>, by whose Invitation we came here, to appoint a
Time when he will please to mention the Reason of his inviting us. As to
our Brother <i>Assaragoa</i>, we have at this present Time nothing to say to
him; not but we have a great deal to say to <i>Assaragoa</i>, which must be
said at one Time or another; but not being satisfied whether he or we
should begin first, we shall leave it wholly to our Brother <i>Onas</i> to
adjust this between us, and to say which shall begin first.</p>

<p><i>Honourable Gentlemen, Commissioners for the Governments of</i> Virginia
<i>and</i> Maryland, <i>and Brethren, Sachims, or Chiefs of the</i> Indians <i>of
the</i> Six Nations.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>t a Treaty, held by me two Years ago, in Behalf of the Government of
<i>Pensylvania</i>, with a Number of the Chiefs of the <i>Indians</i> of the <i>Six
Nations</i>, I was desired by them to write to the Governor of <i>Maryland</i>
concerning some Lands in the back Parts of that Province, which they
claim a Right to from their Conquests over the ancient Possessors, and
which have been settled by some of the Inhabitants of that Government,
without their Consent, or any Purchase made from them. It was at that
time understood that the Claim was upon <i>Maryland</i> only; but it has
since appeared, by some Letters formerly wrote by Mr. President <i>Logan</i>
to the late Governor of <i>Maryland</i>, that it related likewise to some
Lands in the back Parts of <i>Virginia</i>. The Governors of those Colonies
soon manifested a truly equitable Disposition to come to any reasonable
Terms with the <i>Six Nations</i> on account of those Lands, and desired,
that for that End a Time and Place might be fixed for a Treaty with
them; but before this could be effected, an unfortunate Skirmish
happened in the back Parts of <i>Virginia</i>, between some of the Militia
there, and a Party of the <i>Indian</i> Warriors of the <i>Six Nations</i>, with
some Loss on both Sides. Who were the Aggressors is not at this time to
be discussed, both Parties having agreed to bury that Affair in
Oblivion, and the Government of <i>Virginia</i> having, in Token of the
Continuance of their Friendship, presented the <i>Six Nations</i>, through my
Hands, with Goods to the Value of One Hundred Pounds Sterling. To
prevent further Hostilities, and to heal this Breach, I had, before the
Present was given, made a Tender of my good Office; which both Parties
accepted, and consented, on my Instances, to lay down their Arms: Since
which the Faith pledged to me has been mutually preserved, and a Time
and Place has been agreed upon, through my Intervention, for
accommodating all Differences, and for settling a firm Peace, Union and
Friendship, as well between the Government of <i>Virginia</i> as that of
<i>Maryland</i>, and the <i>Indians</i> of the <i>Six Nations</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. The honourable
the Commissioners for these two Governments, and the Deputies of the
<i>Six Nations</i>, are now met at the Place appointed for the Treaty. It
only remains therefore for me to say, that if my further good Offices
shall be thought useful for the Accomplishment of this Work, you may
rely most assuredly upon them.</p>

<p>But I hope, honourable Gentlemen Commissioners, it will not be taken
amiss if I go a little further, and briefly represent to you, how
especially necessary it is at this Juncture, for his Majesty's Service,
and the Good of all his Colonies in this Part of his Dominions, that
Peace and Friendship be established between your Governments and the
<i>Indians</i> of the <i>Six Nations</i>.</p>

<p>These <i>Indians</i>, by their Situation, are a Frontier to some of them;
and, from thence, if Friends, are capable of defending their
Settlements; if Enemies, of making cruel Ravages upon them; if Neuters,
they may deny the <i>French</i> a Passage through their Country, and give us
timely Notice of their Designs. These are but some of the Motives for
cultivating a Good Understanding with them; but from hence the
Disadvantages of a Rupture are abundantly evident. Every Advantage you
gain over them in War will be a weakening of the Barrier of those
Colonies, and consequently be, in effect, Victories over yourselves and
your Fellow Subjects. Some Allowances for their Prejudices and Passions,
and a Present now and then for the Relief of their Necessities, which
have, in some Measure, been brought upon them by their Intercourse with
us, and by our yearly extending our Settlements, will probably tie them
more closely to the <i>British</i> Interest. This has been the Method of
<i>New-York</i> and <i>Pensylvania</i>, and will not put you to so much Expence in
twenty Years, as the carrying on a War against them will do in one. The
<i>French</i> very well know the Importance of these Nations to us, and will
not fail by Presents, and their other usual Arts, to take Advantage of
any Misunderstanding we may have with them<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. But I will detain you,
Gentlemen, no longer. Your own superior Knowledge will suggest to you
more than I can say on this Subject.</p>

<p><i>Friends and Brethren, Sachems, or Chiefs of the</i> Indians <i>of the</i> Six
Nations:</p>

<p>These, your Brethren of <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i>, are come to enlarge
the Fire, which was almost gone out, and to make it burn clearer; to
brighten the Chain which had contracted some Rust, and to renew their
Friendship with you; which it is their Desire may last so long as the
Sun, the Moon and the Stars, shall give Light. Their Powers are derived
from the <i>Great King</i> of <span class="smcap">England</span>, your Father; and whatever Conclusions
they shall come to with you, will be as firm and binding as if the
Governors of these Provinces were themselves here. I am your Brother,
and, which is more, I am your true Friend. As you know, from Experience,
that I am so, I will now give you a few Words of Advice. Receive these
your Brethren with open Arms; unite yourselves to them in the Covenant
Chain, and be you with them as one Body, and one Soul. I make no doubt
but the Governor of <i>Canada</i> has been taking Pains to widen the Breach
between these your Brethren of <i>Virginia</i> and you; but as you cannot
have forgot the Hatred the <i>French</i> have always borne to your Nations,
and how kindly, on the contrary, you have been treated, how faithfully
you have been protected by the <i>Great King</i> of <span class="smcap">England</span> and his Subjects,
you will not be at a Loss to see into the Designs of that Governor. He
wants to divide you from us, in order the more easily to destroy you,
which he will most certainly do, if you suffer yourselves to be deluded
by him.</p>

<p>As to what relates to the Friendship established between the Government
of <i>Pensylvania</i> and your Nations, I will take another Day to speak to
you upon it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>To enforce what had been said, the</i> <span class="smcap">Governor</span> <i>laid down a Belt
of Wampum</i>; <i>upon which the</i> Indians <i>gave the</i> Yo-hah<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p></div>

<p>After a short Pause, the Governor ordered the Interpreter to tell the
<i>Indians</i>, that as they had greatly exceeded their appointed Time for
meeting the Commissioners, he recommended to them to use all the
Expedition possible in giving their Answer to what had been said, that
they might forthwith proceed to treat with the respective Commissioners
on the Business they came about.</p>

<p>Then <i>Canassatego</i> repeated to the Interpreter the Substance of what the
Governor had spoke, in order to know if he had understood him right (a
Method generally made use of by the <i>Indians</i>) and when the Interpreter
told him he had taken the true Sense, <i>Canassatego</i> proceeded to return
the Thanks of the <i>Six Nations</i> for the Governor's kind Advice,
promising to follow it as far as lay in their Power; but as it was their
Custom when a Belt was given to return another, they would take Time
till the Afternoon to provide one, and would then give their Answer.</p>

<h4>In the <span class="smcap"><span class="gesperrt">Court-House</span></span> at <i>Lancaster, June</i> 25, 1744. <i>P. M.</i></h4>

<p>Canassatego's <i>Answer to the Governor's Speech delivered in the Morning</i>.</p>

<p><i>Brother</i> Onas,</p>

<p>You spoke in the Presence of <i>Assaragoa</i> and the Governor of <i>Maryland</i>
to us, advising us to receive them as our Brethren, and to unite with
them in the Covenant Chain as one Body, and one Soul. We have always
considered them as our Brethren, and, as such, shall be willing to
brighten the Chain of Friendship with them; but since there are some
Disputes between us respecting the Lands possessed by them, which
formerly belonged to us, we, according to our Custom, propose to have
those Differences first adjusted, and then we shall proceed to confirm
the Friendship subsisting between us, which will meet with no
Obstruction after these Matters are settled.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Here they presented the</i> <span class="smcap">Governor</span> <i>with a Belt of Wampum, in
return for the Belt given them in the Morning by the</i> <span class="smcap">Governor</span>;
<i>and the Interpreter was ordered to return the</i> Yo-hah.</p></div>

<p><i>Then the</i> <span class="smcap">Governor</span>, <i>in Reply, spoke as follows</i>:</p>

<p>I receive your Belt with great Kindness and Affection; and as to what
relates to the Governments of <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i>, the honourable
Commissioners, now present, are ready to treat with you. I shall only
add, that the Goods for the Hundred Pounds Sterling, put into my Hands
by the Governor of <i>Virginia</i>, as a Token of his good Dispositions to
preserve Friendship with you, are now in Town, and ready to be
delivered, in consequence of what was told you by <i>Conrad Weiser</i> when
he was last at Onandago.</p>

<p>Then the Governor, turning to the Commissioners of <i>Virginia</i> and
<i>Maryland</i>, said, Gentlemen, I have now finished what was incumbent upon
me to say by way of Introduction to the <i>Indians</i>; and as you have a
full Authority from your respective Governments to treat with them, I
shall leave the rest intirely to you, and either stay or withdraw, as
you shall think most for your Service.</p>

<p>The Commissioners said, They were all of Opinion, it would be for their
Advantage that the Governor should stay with them; and therefore they
unanimously desired he would favour them with the Continuance of his
Presence whilst they should be in Treaty with the <i>Indians</i>: Which his
Honour said he would at their Instance very readily do, believing it
might expedite their Business, and prevent any Jealousy the <i>Indians</i>
might conceive at his withdrawing.</p>

<p><i>The Commissioners of</i> Maryland <i>ordered the Interpreter to acquaint
the</i> Indians <i>that the Government of</i> Maryland <i>was going to speak to
them, and then spoke as follows</i>:</p>

<p><i>Friends and Brethren of the united</i> Six Nations,</p>

<p>We, who are deputed from the Government of <i>Maryland</i> by a Commission
under the Great Seal of that Province, now in our Hands (and which will
be interpreted to you) bid you welcome; and in Token that we are very
glad to see you here as Brethren, we give you this String of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Upon which the</i> Indians <i>gave the</i> Yo-hah.</div>

<p>When the Governor of <i>Maryland</i> received the first Notice, about seven
Years ago, of your Claim to some Lands in that Province, he thought our
good Friends and Brethren of the <i>Six Nations</i> had little Reason to
complain of any Injury from <i>Maryland</i>, and that they would be so well
convinced thereof, on farther Deliberation, as he should hear no more of
it; but you spoke of that Matter again to the Governor of <i>Pensylvania</i>,
about two Years since, as if you designed to terrify us.</p>

<p>It was very inconsiderately said by you, that you would do yourselves
Justice, by going to take Payment yourselves: Such an Attempt would have
intirely dissolved the Chain of Friendship subsisting, not only between
us, but perhaps the other <i>English</i> and you.</p>

<p>We assure you, our People, who are numerous, courageous, and have Arms
ready in their Hands, will not suffer themselves to be hurt in their
Lives and Estates.</p>

<p>But, however, the old and wise People of <i>Maryland</i> immediately met in
Council, and upon considering very cooly your rash Expressions, agreed
to invite their Brethren, the <i>Six Nations</i>, to this Place, that they
might learn of them what Right they have to the Land in <i>Maryland</i>, and,
if they had any, to make them some reasonable Compensation for it;
therefore the Governor of <i>Maryland</i> has sent us to meet and treat with
you about this Affair, and the brightening and strengthening the Chain
which hath long subsisted between us. And as an Earnest of our Sincerity
and Good-will towards you, we present you with this Belt of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>On which the</i> Indians <i>gave the</i> Yo-hah.</div>

<p>Our <i>Great King of</i> <span class="smcap">England</span>, and his Subjects, have always possessed the
Province of <i>Maryland</i> free and undisturbed from any Claim of the <i>Six
Nations</i> for above one hundred Years past, and your not saying any thing
to us before, convinces us you thought you had no Pretence to any Lands
in <i>Maryland</i>; nor can we yet find out to what Lands, or under what
Title you make your Claim: For the <i>Sasquahannah Indians</i>, by a Treaty
above ninety Years since (which is on the Table, and will be interpreted
to you) give, and yield to the <i>English</i> Nation, their Heirs and Assigns
for ever, the greatest Part (if not all) of the Lands we possess, from
<i>Patuxent</i> River, on the Western, as well as from <i>Choptank</i> River, on
the Eastern Side of the Great Bay of <i>Chessapeak</i>. And, near Sixty Years
ago, you acknowledged to the Governor of <i>New-York</i> at <i>Albany</i>, "That
you had given your Lands, and submitted yourselves to the King of
<i>England</i>."</p>

<p>We are that Great King's Subjects, and we possess and enjoy the Province
of <i>Maryland</i> by Virtue of his Right and Sovereignty thereto; why, then,
will you stir up any Quarrel between you and ourselves, who are as one
Man, under the Protection of that Great King?</p>

<p>We need not put you in mind of the Treaty (which we suppose you have had
from your Fathers) made with the Province of <i>Maryland</i> near Seventy
Years ago, and renewed and confirmed twice since that time.</p>

<p>By these Treaties we became Brethren; we have always lived as such, and
hope always to continue so.</p>

<p>We have this further to say, that altho' we are not satisfied of the
Justice of your Claim to any Lands in <i>Maryland</i>, yet we are desirous of
shewing our Brotherly Kindness and Affection, and to prevent (by any
reasonable Way) every Misunderstanding between the Province of
<i>Maryland</i> and you our Brethren of the <i>Six Nations</i>.</p>

<p>For this Purpose we have brought hither a Quantity of Goods for our
Brethren the <i>Six Nations</i>, and which will be delivered you as soon as
we shall have received your Answer, and made so bright and large a Fire
as may burn pure and clear whilst the Sun and Moon shall shine.</p>

<p>We have now freely and openly laid our Bosoms bare to you; and that you
may be the better confirmed of the Truth of our Hearts, we give you this
Belt of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the</i> Yo-hah.</div>

<p><i>After a little Time</i> Canassatego <i>spoke as follows:</i></p>

<p><i>Brother, the Governor</i> of Maryland,</p>

<p>We have heard what you have said to us; and, as you have gone back to
old Times, we cannot give you an Answer now, but shall take what you
have said into Consideration, and, return you our Answer some Time to
Morrow. He then sat down, and after some Time he spoke again.</p>

<p><i>Brother, the Governor of</i> Maryland,</p>

<p>If you have made any Enquiry into <i>Indian</i> Affairs, you will know, that
we have always had our Guns, Hatchets and Kettles mended when we came to
see our Brethren. Brother <i>Onas</i>, and the Governor of <i>York</i> always do
this for us; and we give you this early Notice, that we may not thereby
be delayed, being desirous, as well as you, to give all possible
Dispatch to the Business to be transacted between us.</p>

<p>The Commissioners of <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i> said, since it was
customary, they would give Orders to have every Thing belonging to them
mended that should want it.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen you invited us to kindle a Council Fire with you, <i>Conedogwainet</i>
was the Place agreed upon; but afterwards you, by Brother <i>Onas</i>, upon
second Thoughts, considering that it would be difficult to get
Provisions and other Accommodations where there were but few Houses or
Inhabitants, desired we would meet our Brethren at <i>Lancaster</i>, and at
his Instances we very readily agreed to meet you here, and are glad of
the Change; for we have found Plenty of every thing; and as Yesterday
you bid us welcome, and told us you were glad to see us, we likewise
assure you we are as glad to see you; and, in Token of our Satisfaction,
we present you with this String of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremony.</i></div>

<p><i>Brother, the Governor of</i> Maryland,</p>

<p>You tell us, that when about Seven Years ago you heard, by our Brother
<i>Onas</i>, of our Claim to some Lands in your Province, you took no Notice
of it, believing, as you say, that when we should come to reconsider
that Matter, we should find that we had no Right to make any Complaint
of the Governor of <i>Maryland</i>, and would drop our Demand. And that when
about two Years ago we mentioned it again to our Brother <i>Onas</i>, you say
we did it in such Terms as looked like a Design to terrify you; and you
tell us further, that we must be beside ourselves, in using such a rash
Expression as to tell you, We know how to do ourselves Justice if you
still refuse. It is true we did say so, but without any ill Design; for
we must inform you, that when we first desired our Brother <i>Onas</i> to use
his Influence with you to procure us Satisfaction for our Lands, We, at
the same time, desired him, in case you should disregard our Demand, to
write to the Great King beyond the Seas, who would own us for his
Children as well as you, to compel you to do us Justice: And, two years
ago, when we found that you had paid no Regard to our just Demand, nor
that Brother <i>Onas</i> had convey'd our Complaint to the Great King over
the Seas, we were resolved to use such Expressions as would make the
greatest Impressions on your Minds, and we find it had its Effect; for
you tell us, "That your wise Men held a Council together, and agreed to
invite us, and to enquire of our Right to any of your Lands, and if it
should be found that we had a Right, we were to have a Compensation made
for them: And likewise you tell us, that our Brother, the Governor of
<i>Maryland</i>, by the advice of these wise Men, has sent you to brighten
the Chain, and to assure us of his Willingness to remove whatever
impedes a good Understanding between us." This shews that your wise Men
understood our Expressions in their true Sense. We had no Design to
terrify you, but to put you on doing us the Justice you had so long
delayed. Your wise Men have done well; and as there is no Obstacle to a
good Understanding between us, except this Affair of our Land, we, on
our Parts, do give you the strongest Assurances of our good Disposition
towards you, and that we are as desirous as you to brighten the Chain,
and to put away all Hindrances to a perfect good Understanding; and, in
Token of our Sincerity, we give you this Belt of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received, and the Interpreter ordered to give the</i> Yo-hah.</div>

<p><i>Brother, the Governor of</i> Maryland,</p>

<p>When you mentioned the Affair of the Land Yesterday, you went back to
old Times, and told us, you had been in Possession of the Province of
<i>Maryland</i> above One Hundred Years; but what is One Hundred Years in
Comparison of the Length of Time since our Claim began? since we came
out of this Ground? For we must tell you, that long before One Hundred
Years our Ancestors came out of this very Ground, and their Children
have remained here ever since. You came out of the Ground in a Country
that lies beyond the Seas, there you may have a just Claim, but here you
must allow us to be your elder Brethren, and the Lands to belong to us
long before you knew any thing of them. It is true, that above One
Hundred Years ago the <i>Dutch</i> came here in a Ship, and brought with them
several Goods; such as Awls, Knives, Hatchets, Guns, and many other
Particulars, which they gave us; and when they had taught us how to use
their Things, and we saw what sort of People they were, we were so well
pleased with them, that we tied their Ship to the Bushes on the Shore;
and afterwards, liking them still better the longer they staid with us,
and thinking the Bushes too slender, we removed the Rope, and tied it to
the Trees; and as the Trees were liable to be blown down by high Winds,
or to decay of themselves, we, from the Affection we bore them, again
removed the Rope, and tied it to a strong and big Rock [<i>here the
Interpreter said, They mean the</i> Oneido <i>Country</i>] and not content with
this, for its further Security we removed the Rope to the big Mountain
[<i>here the Interpreter says they mean the</i> Onandago <i>Country</i>] and there
we tied it very fast, and roll'd Wampum about it; and, to make it still
more secure, we stood upon the Wampum, and sat down upon it, to defend
it, and to prevent any Hurt coming to it, and did our best Endeavours
that it might remain uninjured for ever. During all this Time the
New-comers, the <i>Dutch</i>, acknowledged our Right to the Lands, and
sollicited us, from Time to Time, to grant them Parts of our Country,
and to enter into League and Covenant with us, and to become one people
with us.</p>

<p>After this the <i>English</i> came into the Country, and, as we were told,
became one People with the <i>Dutch</i>. About two Years after the Arrival of
the <i>English</i>, an <i>English</i> Governor came to <i>Albany</i>, and finding what
great Friendship subsisted between us and the <i>Dutch</i>, he approved it
mightily, and desired to make as strong a League, and to be upon as good
Terms with us as the <i>Dutch</i> were, with whom he was united, and to
become one People with us: And by his further Care in looking into what
had passed between us, he found that the Rope which tied the Ship to the
great Mountain was only fastened with Wampum, which was liable to break
and rot, and to perish in a Course of Years; he therefore told us, he
would give us a Silver Chain, which would be much stronger, and would
last for ever. This we accepted, and fastened the Ship with it, and it
has lasted ever since. Indeed we have had some small Differences with
the <i>English</i>, and, during these Misunderstandings, some of their young
Men would, by way of Reproach, be every now and then telling us, that we
should have perished if they had not come into the Country and furnished
us with Strowds and Hatchets, and Guns, and other Things necessary for
the Support of Life; but we always gave them to understand that they
were mistaken, that we lived before they came amongst us, and as well,
or better, if we may believe what our Forefathers have told us. We had
then Room enough, and Plenty of Deer, which was easily caught; and tho'
we had not Knives, Hatchets, or Guns, such as we have now, yet we had
Knives of Stone, and Hatchets of Stone, and Bows and Arrows, and those
served our Uses as well then as the <i>English</i> ones do now. We are now
straitened, and sometimes in want of Deer, and liable to many other
Inconveniencies since the <i>English</i> came among us, and particularly from
that Pen-and-Ink Work that is going on at the Table (<i>pointing to the
Secretary</i>) and we will give you an Instance of this. Our Brother
<i>Onas</i>, a great while ago, came to <i>Albany</i> to buy the <i>Sasquahannah</i>
Lands of us, but our Brother the Governor of <i>New-York</i>, who, as we
suppose, had not a good Understanding with our Brother <i>Onas</i>, advised
us not to sell him any Land, for he would make an ill Use of it; and,
pretending to be our good Friend, he advised us, in order to prevent
<i>Onas</i>'s, or any other Person's imposing upon us, and that we might
always have our Land when we should want it, to put it into his Hands;
and told us, he would keep it for our Use, and never open his Hands, but
keep them close shut, and not part with any of it, but at our Request.
Accordingly we trusted him, and put our Land into his Hands, and charged
him to keep it safe for our Use; but, some Time after, he went to
<i>England</i>, and carried our Land with him, and there sold it to our
Brother <i>Onas</i> for a large Sum of Money; and when, at the Instance of
our Brother <i>Onas</i>, we were minded to sell him some Lands, he told us we
had sold the <i>Sasquahannah</i> Lands already to the Governor of <i>New-York</i>,
and that he had bought them from him in <i>England</i>; tho', when he came to
understand how the Governor of <i>New-York</i> had deceived us, he very
generously paid us for our Lands over again.</p>

<p>Tho' we mention this Instance of an Imposition put upon us by the
Governor of <i>New-York</i>, yet we must do the <i>English</i> the Justice to say,
we have had their hearty Assistances in our Wars with the <i>French</i>, who
were no sooner arrived amongst us than they began to render us uneasy,
and to provoke us to War, and we had several Wars with them; during all
which we constantly received Assistance from the <i>English</i>, and, by
their Means, we have always been able to keep up our Heads against their
Attacks.</p>

<p>We now come nearer home. We have had your Deeds interpreted to us, and
we acknowledge them to be good and valid, and that the <i>Conestogoe</i> or
<i>Sasquahannah Indians</i> had a Right to sell those Lands to you, for they
were then theirs; but since that Time we have conquered them, and their
Country now belongs to us, and the Lands we demanded Satisfaction for
are no Part of the Lands comprized in those Deeds; they are the
<i>Cohongorontas</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Lands; those, we are sure, you have not possessed One
Hundred Years, no, nor above Ten Years, and we made our Demands so soon
as we knew your People were settled in those Parts. These have never
been sold, but remain still to be disposed of; and we are well pleased
to hear you are provided with Goods, and do assure you of our
Willingness to treat with you for those unpurchased Lands; in
Confirmation whereof, we present you with this Belt of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremonies.</i></div>

<p><i><span class="gesperrt">CANASSATEGO</span></i> added, that as the three Governors of <i>Virginia,
Maryland</i>, and <i>Pensylvania</i>, had divided the Lands among them, they
could not, for this Reason, tell how much each had got, nor were they
concerned about it, so that they were paid by all the Governors for the
several Parts each possessed, and this they left to their Honour and
Justice.</p>

<p><i>The Commissioners of</i> Virginia <i>ordered the Interpreter to let the</i>

and then they spoke as follows:</i></p>

<p><i>Sachems and Warriors of the</i> Six United Nations, <i>our Friends and
Brethren,</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>t our Desire the Governor of <i>Pensylvania</i> invited you to this Council
Fire; we have waited a long Time for you, but now you are come, you are
heartily welcome; we are very glad to see you; we give you this String
of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with their usual Approbation.</i></div>

<p><i>Brethren,</i></p>

<p>In the Year 1736, four of your Sachems wrote a Letter to <i>James Logan</i>,
Esq; then President of <i>Pensylvania</i>, to let the Governor of <i>Virginia</i>
know that you expected some Consideration for Lands in the Occupation of
some of the People of <i>Virginia</i>. Upon seeing a Copy of this Letter, the
Governor, with the Council of <i>Virginia</i>, took some Time to consider of
it. They found, on looking into the old Treaties, that you had given up
your Lands to the Great King, who has had Possession of <i>Virginia</i> above
One Hundred and Sixty Years, and under that Great King the Inhabitants
of <i>Virginia</i> hold their Land, so they thought there might be some
Mistake.</p>

<p>Wherefore they desired the Governor of <i>New-York</i> to enquire of you
about it. He sent his Interpreter to you in <i>May,</i> 1743, who laid this
before you at a Council held at <i>Onandago</i>, to which you answer, "That
if you had any Demand or Pretensions on the Governor of <i>Virginia</i> any
way, you would have made it known to the Governor of <i>New-York</i>." This
corresponds with what you have said to Governor <i>Thomas,</i> in the Treaty
made with him at <i>Philadelphia</i> in <i>July</i>, 1742; for then you only make
your Claim to Lands in the Government of <i>Maryland</i>.</p>

<p>We are so well pleased with this good Faith of you our Brethren of the
<i>Six Nations</i>, and your Regard to the Treaties made with <i>Virginia</i>,
that we are ready to hear you on the Subject of your Message eight years
since.</p>

<p>Tell us what Nations of <i>Indians</i> you conquered any Lands from in
<i>Virginia</i>, how long it is since, and what Possession you have had; and
if it does appear, that there is any Land on the Borders of <i>Virginia</i>
that the <i>Six Nations</i> have a Right to, we are willing to make you
Satisfaction.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<i>Then laid down a String of Wampum, which was accepted with the usual

<p>We have a Chest of new Goods, and the Key is in our Pockets. You are our
Brethren; the Great King is our common Father, and we will live with
you, as Children ought to do, in Peace and Love.</p>

<p>We will brighten the Chain, and strengthen the Union between us; so that
we shall never be divided, but remain Friends and Brethren as long as
the Sun gives Light; in Confirmation whereof, we give you this Belt of
Wampum.</p>

to every Part of it some Time this Afternoon, and we will let you know
when we are ready.</p>

<p><i><span class="gesperrt">TACHANOONTIA</span> spoke as follows</i>:</p>

<p><i>Brother</i> Assaragoa,</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>ince you have joined with the Governor of <i>Maryland</i> and Brother <i>Onas</i>
in kindling this Fire, we gladly acknowledge the Pleasure we have in
seeing you here, and observing your good Dispositions as well to
confirm the Treaties of Friendship, as to enter into further Contracts
about Land with us; and, in Token of our Satisfaction, we present you
with this String of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremonies</i>.</div>

<p><i>Brother</i> Assaragoa,</p>

<p>In your Speech this Morning you were pleased to say we had wrote a
Letter to <i>James Logan</i>, about seven Years ago, to demand a
Consideration for our Lands in the Possession of some of the
<i>Virginians</i>; that you held them under the Great King for upwards of One
Hundred and Sixty Years, and that we had already given up our Right; and
that therefore you had desired the Governor of <i>New-York</i> to send his
Interpreter to us last Year to <i>Onandago</i>, which he did; and, as you
say, we in Council at <i>Onandago</i> did declare, that we had no Demand upon
you for Lands, and that if we had any Pretensions, we should have made
them known to the Governor of <i>New-York</i>; and likewise you desire to
know if we have any Right to the <i>Virginia</i> Lands, and that we will make
such Right appear, and tell you what Nations of <i>Indians</i> we conquered
those Lands from.</p>

<p>Now we answer, We have the Right of Conquest, a Right too dearly
purchased, and which cost us too much Blood, to give up without any
Reason at all, as you say we have done at <i>Albany</i>; but we should be
obliged to you, if you would let us see the Letter, and inform us who
was the Interpreter, and whose Names are put to that Letter; for as the
whole Transaction cannot be above a Year's standing, it must be fresh in
every Body's Memory, and some of our Council would easily remember it;
but we assure you, and are well able to prove, that neither we, nor any
Part of us, have ever relinquished our Right, or ever gave such an
Answer as you say is mentioned in your Letter. Could we, so few Years
ago, make a formal Demand, by <i>James Logan</i>, and not be sensible of our
Right? And hath any thing happened since that Time to make us less
sensible? No; and as this Matter can be easily cleared up, we are
anxious it should be done; for we are positive no such thing was ever
mentioned to us at <i>Onandago</i>, nor any where else. All the World knows
we conquered the several Nations living on <i>Sasquahannah</i>,
<i>Cohongoronta</i>, and on the Back of the Great Mountains in <i>Virginia</i>;
the <i>Conoy-uch-such-roona</i>, <i>Coch-now-was-roonan, Tohoa-irough-roonan</i>,
and <i>Connutskin-ough-roonaw</i>, feel the Effects of our Conquests, being
now a Part of our Nations, and their Lands at our Disposal. We know very
well, it hath often been said by the <i>Virginians</i>, that the <i>Great King</i>
of <span class="smcap">England</span>, and the People of that Colony, conquered the <i>Indians</i> who
lived there, but it is not true. We will allow they have conquered the
<i>Sachdagughroonaw</i>, and drove back the <i>Tuscarroraws</i>, and that they
have, on that Account, a Right to some Part of <i>Virginia</i>; but as to
what lies beyond the Mountains, we conquered the Nations residing there,
and that Land, if the <i>Virginians</i> ever get a good Right to it, it must
be by us; and in Testimony of the Truth of our Answer to this Part of
your Speech, we give you this String of Wampum</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremony</i>.</div>

<p><i>Brother</i> Assaragoa,</p>

<p>We have given you a full Answer to the first Part of your Speech, which
we hope will be satisfactory. We are glad to hear you have brought with
you a big Chest of new Goods, and that you have the Key in your Pockets.
We do not doubt but we shall have a good Understanding in all Points,
and come to an Agreement with you.</p>

<p>We shall open all our Hearts to you, that you may know every thing in
them; we will hide nothing from you; and we hope, if there be any thing
still remaining in your Breast that may occasion any Dispute between us,
you will take the Opportunity to unbosom your Hearts, and lay them open
to us, that henceforth there may be no Dirt, nor any other Obstacle in
the Road between us; and in Token of our hearty Wishes to bring about so
good an Harmony, we present you with this Belt of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremony</i>.</div>

<p><i>Brother</i> Assaragoa,</p>

<p>We must now tell you what Mountains we mean that we say are the
Boundaries between you and us. You may remember, that about twenty Years
ago you had a Treaty with us at <i>Albany</i>, when you took a Belt of
Wampum, and made a Fence with it on the Middle of the Hill, and told us,
that if any of the Warriors of the <i>Six Nations</i> came on your Side of
the Middle of the Hill, you would hang them; and you gave us Liberty to
do the same with any of your People who should be found on our Side of
the Middle of the Hill. This is the Hill we mean; and we desire that
Treaty may be now confirmed. After we left <i>Albany</i>, we brought our Road
a great deal more to the West, that we might comply with your Proposal;
but, tho' it was of your own making, your People never observed it, but
came and lived on our Side of the Hill, which we don't blame you for, as
you live at a great Distance, near the Seas, and cannot be thought to
know what your People do in the Back-parts: And on their settling,
contrary to your own Proposal, on our new Road, it fell out that our
Warriors did some Hurt to your People's Cattle, of which a Complaint was
made, and transmitted to us by our Brother <i>Onas</i>; and we, at his
Request, altered the Road again, and brought it to the Foot of the
Great Mountain, where it now is; and it is impossible for us to remove
it any further to the West, those Parts of the Country being absolutely
impassable by either Man or Beast.</p>

<p>We had not been long in the Use of this new Road before your People
came, like Flocks of Birds, and sat down on both Sides of it, and yet we
never made a Complaint to you, tho' you must be sensible those Things
must have been done by your People in manifest Breach of your own
Proposal made at <i>Albany</i>; and therefore, as we are now opening our
Hearts to you, we cannot avoid complaining, and desire all these Affairs
may be settled, and that you may be stronger induced to do us Justice
for what is past, and to come to a thorough Settlement for the future,
we, in the Presence of the Governor of <i>Maryland</i>, and Brother Onas,
present you with this Belt of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremony</i>.</div>

<p><i>Then</i> Tachanoontia <i>added</i>:</p>

<p>That he forgot to say, that the Affair of the Road must be looked upon
as a Preliminary to be settled before the Grant of Lands; and, said he,
either the <i>Virginia</i> People must be obliged to remove more Easterly,
or, if they are permitted to stay, our Warriors, marching that Way to
the Southward, shall go Sharers with them in what they plant.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Governor</span> spoke as follows.</p>

<p><i>Friends and Brethren of the</i> Six Nations,</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> am always sorry when any thing happens that may create the least
Uneasiness between us; but as we are mutually engaged to keep the Road
between us clear and open, and to remove every Obstruction that may lie
in the Way, I must inform you, that three of the <i>Delaware Indians</i>
lately murdered <i>John Armstrong</i>, an <i>Indian</i> Trader, and his two Men,
in a most barbarous Manner, as he was travelling to <i>Allegheny</i>, and
stole his Goods of a considerable Value. <i>Shickcalamy</i>, and the
<i>Indians</i> settled at <i>Shamokin</i>, did well; they seized two of the
Murderers, and sent them down to our Settlements; but the <i>Indians</i>, who
had the Charge of them, afterwards suffered one of them to escape, on a
Pretence that he was not concerned in the bloody Deed; the other is now
in <i>Philadelphia</i> Goal. By our Law all the Accessaries to a Murder are
to be tried, and put to Death, as well as the Person who gave the deadly
Wound. If they consented to it, encouraged it, or any ways assisted in
it, they are to be put to Death, and it is just it should be so. If,
upon Trial, the Persons present at the Murder are found not to have done
any of these Things, they are set at Liberty. Two of our People were,
not many Years ago, publickly put to Death for killing two <i>Indians</i>; we
therefore expect you will take the most effectual Measures to seize and
deliver up to us the other two <i>Indians</i> present at these Murders, to be
tried with the Principal now in Custody. If it shall appear, upon their
Trial, that they were not advising, or any way assisting in this horrid
Fact, they will be acquitted, and sent home to their Towns. And that you
may be satisfied no Injustice will be done to them, I do now invite you
to depute three or four <i>Indians</i> to be present at their Trials. I do
likewise expect that you will order strict Search to be made for the
Remainder of the stolen Goods, that they may be restored to the Wife and
Children of the Deceased. That what I have said may have its due Weight
with you, I give you this String of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was accepted with the</i> Yo-hah.</div>

<p>The Governor afterwards ordered the Interpreter to tell them, he
expected a very full Answer from them, and that they might take their
own Time to give it; for he did not desire to interfere with the
Business of <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i>.</p>

<p>They said they would take it into Consideration, and give a full Answer.</p>

<p>Then the Commissioners of <i>Virginia</i> let them know, by the Interpreter,
that they would speak to them in the Afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Our good Friends and Brethren, the</i> Six <i>united</i> Nations,</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>e have considered what you said concerning your Title to some Lands now
in our Province, and also of the Place where they lie. Altho' we cannot
admit your Right, yet we are so resolved to live in Brotherly Love and
Affection with the <i>Six Nations</i>, that upon your giving us a Release in
Writing of all your Claim to any Lands in <i>Maryland</i>, we shall make you
a Compensation to the Value of Three Hundred Pounds Currency, for the
Payment of Part whereof we have brought some Goods, and shall make up
the rest in what Manner you think fit.</p>

<p>As we intend to say something to you about our Chain of Friendship after
this Affair of the Land is settled, we desire you will now examine the
Goods, and make an End of this Matter.</p>

notwithstanding we are likely to come to an Agreement about your Claim

<div class="blockquot"><i>On presenting of which the</i> Indians <i>gave the usual Cry of Approbation</i>.</div>

<p>Mr. <i>Weiser</i> acquainted the <i>Indians</i>, they might now look over the
several Goods placed on a Table in the Chamber for that Purpose; and the
honourable Commissioners bid him tell them, if they disliked any of the
Goods, or, if they were damaged, the Commissioners would put a less
Price on such as were either disliked or damnified.</p>

<p>The <i>Indians</i> having viewed and examined the Goods, and seeming
dissatisfied at the Price and Worth of them, required Time to go down
into the Court-House, in order for a Consultation to be had by the
Chiefs of them concerning the said Goods, and likewise that the
Interpreter might retire with them, which he did. Accordingly they went
down into the Court-House, and soon after returned again into the
Chamber.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Weiser</i> sat down among the <i>Indians</i>, and discoursed them about the
Goods, and in some short Time after they chose the following from among
the others, and the Price agreed to be given for them by the <i>Six

<p>When the <i>Indians</i> had agreed to take these Goods at the Rates above
specified, they informed the Interpreter, that they would give an Answer

Answer should be made. At 12 o'Clock the Commissioners departed the

<h4>In the <span class="smcap"><span class="gesperrt">Court-House</span></span> at <i>Lancaster, June</i> 28, 1744. <i>P. M.</i></h4>

<h4><span class="gesperrt">PRESENT</span>,</h4>

The Honourable <i><span class="gesperrt">GEORGE THOMAS</span></i>, Esq; Governor, &amp;c.<br />

The Honourable the Commissioners of <i>Virginia</i>.<br />

The Honourable the Commissioners of <i>Maryland</i>.<br />

The Deputies of the <i>Six Nations</i>.<br />

<i>Conrad Weiser</i>, Interpreter.<br />

<p><i>The Commissioners of</i> Virginia <i>desired the Interpreter to let the</i>
Indians <i>know, that their Brother</i> Assaragoa <i>was now going to give his
Reply to their Answer to his first Speech, delivered them the Day before
in the Forenoon</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sachems and Warriors of the united</i> Six Nations,</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e are now come to answer what you said to us Yesterday, since what we
said to you before on the Part of the Great King, our Father, has not
been satisfactory. You have gone into old Times, and so must we. It is
true that the Great King holds <i>Virginia</i> by Right of Conquest, and the
Bounds of that Conquest to the Westward is the Great Sea.</p>

<p>If the <i>Six Nations</i> have made any Conquest over <i>Indians</i> that may at
any Time have lived on the West-side of the Great Mountains of
<i>Virginia</i>, yet they never possessed any Lands there that we have ever
heard of. That Part was altogether deserted, and free for any People to
enter upon, as the People of <i>Virginia</i> have done, by Order of the Great
King, very justly, as well by ancient Right, as by its being freed from
the Possession of any other, and from any Claim even of you the <i>Six
Nations</i>, our Brethren, until within these eight Years. The first Treaty
between the Great King, in Behalf of his Subjects of <i>Virginia</i>, and
you, that we can find, was made at <i>Albany</i>, by Colonel <i>Henry Coursey</i>,
Seventy Years since; this was a Treaty of Friendship, when the first
Covenant Chain was made, when we and you became Brethren.</p>

<p>The next Treaty was also at <i>Albany</i>, above Fifty-eight Years ago, by
the Lord <i>Howard</i>, Governor of <i>Virginia</i>; then you declared yourselves
Subjects to the Great King, our Father, and gave up to him all your
Lands for his Protection. This you own in a Treaty made by the Governor
of <i>New-York</i> with you at the same Place in the Year 1687, and you
express yourself in these Words, "Brethren, you tell us the King of
<i>England</i> is a very great King, and why should not you join with us in a
very just Cause, when the <i>French</i> join with our Enemies in an unjust
Cause? O Brethren, we see the Reason of this; for the <i>French</i> would
fain kill us all, and when that is done, they would carry all the Beaver
Trade to <i>Canada</i>, and the <i>Great King of</i> <span class="smcap">England</span> would lose the Land
likewise; and therefore, O Great Sachem, beyond the Great Lakes, awake,
and suffer not those poor <i>Indians</i>, that have given themselves and
their Lands under your Protection, to be destroyed by the <i>French</i>
without a Cause."</p>

<p>The last Treaty we shall speak to you about is that made at <i>Albany</i> by
Governor <i>Spotswood</i>, which you have not recited as it is: For the white
People, your Brethren of <i>Virginia</i>, are, in no Article of that Treaty,
prohibited to pass, and settle to the Westward of the Great Mountains.
It is the <i>Indians</i>, tributary to <i>Virginia</i>, that are restrained, as
you and your tributary <i>Indians</i> are from passing to the Eastward of the
same Mountains, or to the Southward of <i>Cohongorooton</i>, and you agree to
this Article in these Words; "That the Great River of <i>Potowmack</i>, and
the high Ridge of Mountains, which extend all along the Frontiers of
<i>Virginia</i> to the Westward of the present Settlements of that Colony,
shall be for ever the established Boundaries between the <i>Indians</i>
subject to the Dominions of <i>Virginia</i>, and the <i>Indians</i> belonging to
and depending on the <i>Five Nations</i>; so that neither our <i>Indians</i> shall
on any Pretence whatsoever, pass to Northward or Westward of the said
Boundaries, without having to produce a Passport under the Hand and Seal
of the Governor or Commander in Chief of <i>Virginia</i>; nor your <i>Indians</i>
to pass to the Southward or Eastward of the said Boundaries, without a
Passport in like Manner from the Governor or Commander in Chief of
<i>New-York</i>."</p>

<p>And what Right can you have to Lands that you have no Right to walk
upon, but upon certain Conditions? It is true, you have not observed
this Part of the Treaty, and your Brethren of <i>Virginia</i> have not
insisted upon it with a due Strictness, which has occasioned some
Mischief.</p>

<p>This Treaty has been sent to the Governor of <i>Virginia</i> by Order of the
Great King, and is what we must rely on, and, being in Writing, is more
certain than your Memory. That is the Way the white People have of
preserving Transactions of every Kind, and transmitting them down to
their Childrens Children for ever, and all Disputes among them are
settled by this faithful kind of Evidence, and must be the Rule between
the Great King and you. This Treaty your Sachems and Warriors signed
some Years after the same Governor <i>Spotswood</i>, in the Right of the
Great King, had been, with some People of <i>Virginia</i>, in Possession of
these very Lands, which you have set up your late Claim to.</p>

<p>The Commissioners for <i>Indian</i> Affairs at <i>Albany</i> gave the Account we
mentioned to you Yesterday to the Governor of <i>New-York</i>, and he sent it
to the Governor of <i>Virginia</i>; their Names will be given you by the
Interpreter.</p>

<p><i>Brethren</i>,</p>

<p>This Dispute is not between <i>Virginia</i> and you; it is setting up your
Right against the Great King, under whose Grants the People you complain
of are settled. Nothing but a Command from the Great King can remove
them; they are too powerful to be removed by any Force of you, our
Brethren; and the Great King, as our common Father, will do equal
Justice to all his Children; wherefore we do believe they will be
confirmed in their Possessions.</p>

<p>As to the Road you mention, we intended to prevent any Occasion for it,
by making a Peace between you and the Southern <i>Indians</i>, a few Years
since, at a considerable Expence to our Great King, which you confirmed
at <i>Albany</i>. It seems, by your being at War with the <i>Catawbas</i>, that
it has not been long kept between you.</p>

<p>However, if you desire a Road, we will agree to one on the Terms of the
Treaty you made with Colonel <i>Spotswood</i>, and your People, behaving
themselves orderly like Friends and Brethren, shall be used in their
Passage through <i>Virginia</i> with the same Kindness as they are when they
pass through the Lands of your Brother <i>Onas</i>. This we hope, will be
agreed to by you our Brethren, and we will abide by the Promise made to
you Yesterday.</p>

<p>We may proceed to settle what we are to give you for any Right you may
have, or have had to all the Lands to the Southward and Westward of the
Lands of your Brother the Governor of <i>Maryland</i>, and of your Brother
Onas; tho' we are informed that the Southern <i>Indians</i> claim these very
Lands that you do.</p>

<p>We are desirous to live with you, our Brethren, according to the old
Chain of Friendship, to settle all these Matters fairly and honestly;
and, as a Pledge of our Sincerity, we give you this Belt of Wampum.</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i> Weiser <i>informed the honourable Commissioners</i>, <i>that the</i> Indians
<i>were ready to give their Answer to the Speech made to them here
Yesterday Morning by the Commissioners</i>; <i>whereupon</i> Canassatego <i>spoke
as follows, looking on a Deal-board, where were some black Lines,
describing the Courses of</i> Potowmack <i>and</i> Sasquahanna:</p>

<p><i>Brethren</i>,</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">Y</span>esterday you spoke to us concerning the Lands on this Side <i>Potowmack</i>
River, and as we have deliberately considered what you said to us on
that Matter, we are now very ready to settle the Bounds of such Lands,
and release our Right and Claim thereto.</p>

<p>We are willing to renounce all Right to Lord <i>Baltimore</i> of all those
Lands lying two Miles above the uppermost Fork of <i>Potowmack</i> or
<i>Cohongoruton</i> River, near which <i>Thomas Cressap</i> has a hunting or
trading Cabin, by a North-line, to the Bounds of <i>Pensylvania</i>. But in
case such Limits shall not include every Settlement or Inhabitant of
<i>Maryland</i>, then such other Lines and Courses, from the said two Miles
above the Forks, to the outermost Inhabitants or Settlements, as shall
include every Settlement and Inhabitant in <i>Maryland</i>, and from thence,
by a North-line, to the Bounds of <i>Pensylvannia</i>, shall be the Limits.
And further, If any People already have, or shall settle beyond the
Lands now described and bounded, they shall enjoy the same free from any
Disturbance whatever, and we do, and shall accept these people for our
Brethren, and as such always treat them.</p>

<p>We earnestly desire to live with you as Brethren, and hope you will shew
us all Brotherly Kindness; in Token whereof, we present you with a Belt
of Wampum.</p>

Chamber at <i>Lancaster</i>, <i>June</i> 30, 1744, <i>A. M.</i></h4>

<h4><span class="gesperrt">PRESENT</span>,</h4>

The Honourable the Commissioners of <i>Virginia</i>.<br />

The Deputies of the <i>Six Nations</i>.<br />

<i>Conrad Weiser</i>, Interpreter.<br />

<p>Gachradodow, <i>Speaker for the</i> Indians, <i>in answer to the Commissioners
Speech at the last Meeting</i>, <i>with a strong Voice, and proper Action,
spoke as follows</i>:</p>

<p><i>Brother</i> Assaragoa,</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he World at the first was made on the other Side of the Great Water
different from what it is on this Side, as may be known from the
different Colours of our Skin, and of our Flesh, and that which you call
Justice may not be so amongst us; you have your Laws and Customs, and so
have we. The Great King might send you over to conquer the <i>Indians</i>,
but it looks to us that God did not approve of it; if he had, he would
not have placed the Sea where it is, as the Limits between us and you.</p>

<p><i>Brother</i> Assaragoa,</p>

<p>Tho' great Things are well remembered among us, yet we don't remember
that we were ever conquered by the Great King, or that we have been
employed by that Great King to conquer others; if it was so, it is
beyond our Memory. We do remember we were employed by <i>Maryland</i> to
conquer the <i>Conestogoes</i>, and that the second time we were at War with
them, we carried them all off.</p>

<p><i>Brother</i> Assaragoa,</p>

<p>You charge us with not acting agreeable to our Peace with the
<i>Catawbas</i>, we will repeat to you truly what was done. The Governor of
<i>New-York</i>, at <i>Albany</i>, in Behalf of <i>Assaragoa</i>, gave us several Belts
of Wampum from the <i>Cherikees</i> and <i>Catawbas</i>, and we agreed to a Peace,
if those Nations would send some of their great Men to us to confirm it
Face to Face, and that they would trade with us; and desired that they
would appoint a Time to meet at <i>Albany</i> for that Purpose, but they
never came.</p>

<p><i>Brother</i> Assaragoa,</p>

<p>We then desired a Letter might be sent to the <i>Catawbas</i> and
<i>Cherikees</i>, to desire them to come and confirm the Peace. It was long
before an Answer came; but we met the <i>Cherikees</i>, and confirmed the
Peace, and sent some of our People to take care of them, until they
returned to their own Country.</p>

<p>The <i>Catawbas</i> refused to come, and sent us word, That we were but
Women, that they were Men, and double Men, that they could make Women of
us, and would be always at War with us. They are a deceitful People. Our
Brother <i>Assaragoa</i> is deceived by them; we don't blame him for it, but
are sorry he is so deceived.</p>

<p><i>Brother</i> Assaragoa,</p>

<p>We have confirmed the Peace with the <i>Cherikees</i>, but not with the
<i>Catawbas</i>. They have been treacherous, and know it; so that the War
must continue till one of us is destroyed. This we think proper to tell
you, that you may not be troubled at what we do to the <i>Catawbas</i>.</p>

<p><i>Brother</i> Assaragoa,</p>

<p>We will now speak to the Point between us. You say you will agree with
us as to the Road; we desire that may be the Road which was last made
(the Waggon-Road.) It is always, a Custom among Brethren or Strangers to
use each other kindly; you have some very ill-natured People living up
there; so that we desire the Persons in Power may know that we are to
have reasonable Victuals when we are in want.</p>

<p>You know very well, when the white People came first here they were
poor; but now they have got our Lands, and are by them become rich, and
we are now poor; what little we have had for the Land goes soon away,
but the Land lasts for ever. You told us you had brought with you a
Chest of Goods, and that you have the Key in your Pockets; but we have
never seen the Chest, nor the Goods that are said to be in it; it may be
small, and the Goods few; we want to see them, and are desirous to come
to some Conclusion. We have been sleeping here these ten Days past, and
have not done any thing to the Purpose.</p>

<p>The Commissioners told them they should see the Goods on <i>Monday</i>.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he three Governments entertained the <i>Indians</i>, and all the Gentlemen
in Town, with a handsome Dinner. The <i>Six Nations</i>, in their Order,
having returned Thanks with the usual Solemnity of <i>Yo-ha-han</i>, the
Interpreter informed the Governor and the Commissioners, that as the
Lord Proprietor and Governor of <i>Maryland</i> was not known to the
<i>Indians</i> by any particular Name, they had agreed, in Council, to take
the first Opportunity of a large Company to present him with one; and as
this with them is deemed a Matter of great Consequence, and attended
with Abundance of Form, the several Nations had drawn Lots for the
Performance of the Ceremony, and the Lot falling on the <i>Cayogo</i> Nation,
they had chosen <i>Gachradodow</i>, one of their Chiefs, to be their Speaker,
and he desired Leave to begin; which being given, he, on an elevated
Part of the Court-House, with all the Dignity of a Warrior, the Gesture
of an Orator, and in a very graceful Posture, said that:</p>

<p>"As the Governor of <i>Maryland</i> had invited them here to treat about
their Lands, and brighten the Chain of Friendship, the united Nations
thought themselves so much obliged to them, that they had come to a
Resolution in Council to give to the great Man, who is Proprietor of
<i>Maryland</i>, a particular Name, by which they might hereafter correspond
with him; and as it had fallen to the <i>Cayogoes</i> Lot in Council to
consider of a proper Name for that chief Man, they had agreed to give
him the Name of <i>Tocarry-hogan</i>, denoting Precedency, Excellency, or
living in the middle or honourable Place betwixt <i>Assaragoa</i> and their
Brother <i>Onas</i>, by whom their Treaties might be better carried on." And
then, addressing himself to his Honour the Governor of <i>Pensylvania</i>,
the honourable the Commissioners of <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i>, and to
the Gentlemen then present, he proceeded:</p>

<p>"As there is a Company of great Men now assembled, we take this Time and
Opportunity to publish this Matter, that it may be known <i>Tocarry-hogan</i>
is our Friend, and that we are ready to honour him, and that by such
Name he may be always called and known among us. And we hope he will
ever act towards us according to the Excellency of the Name we have now
given him, and enjoy a long and happy Life."</p>

<p>The honourable the Governor and Commissioners, and all the Company
present, returned the Compliment with three Huzza's, and, after drinking
Healths to our gracious King and the <i>Six Nations</i>, the Commissioners of
<i>Maryland</i> proceeded to Business in the Court-House Chamber with the
<i>Indians</i>, where <i>Conrad Weiser</i>, the Interpreter, was present.</p>

<p>The honourable the Commissioners ordered Mr. <i>Weiser</i> to tell the
<i>Indians</i>, that a Deed, releasing all their Claim and Title to certain
Lands lying in the Province of <i>Maryland</i>, which by them was agreed to
be given and executed for the Use of the Lord Baron of <i>Baltimore</i>,
Lord Proprietary of that Province, was now on the Table, and Seals ready
fixed thereto. The Interpreter acquainted them therewith as desired, and
then gave the Deed to <i>Canassatego</i>, the Speaker, who made his Mark, and
put his Seal, and delivered it; after which, thirteen other Chiefs or
Sachems of the <i>Six Nations</i> executed it in the same Manner, in the
Presence of the honourable the Commissioners of <i>Virginia</i>, and divers
other Gentlemen of that Colony, and of the Provinces of <i>Pensylvania</i>
and <i>Maryland</i>.</p>

<p><i>Brother</i> Onas,</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he other Day you was pleased to tell us, you were always concerned
whenever any thing happened that might give you or us Uneasiness, and
that we were mutually engaged to preserve the Road open and clear
between us; and you informed us of the Murder of <i>John Armstrong</i>, and
his two Men, by some of the <i>Delaware Indians</i>, and of their stealing
his Goods to a considerable Value. The <i>Delaware Indians</i>, as you
suppose, are under our Power. We join with you in your Concern for such
a vile Proceeding; and, to testify that we have the same Inclinations
with you to keep the Road clear, free and open, we give you this String
of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremony</i>.</div>

<p><i>Brother</i> Onas,</p>

<p>These Things happen frequently, and we desire you will consider them
well, and not be too much concerned. Three <i>Indians</i> have been killed
at different Times at <i>Ohio</i>, and we never mentioned any of them to you,
imagining it might have been occasioned by some unfortunate Quarrels,
and being unwilling to create a Disturbance. We therefore desire you
will consider these Things well, and, to take the Grief from your Heart,
we give you this String of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremonies</i>.</div>

<p><i>Brother</i> Onas,</p>

<p>We have heard of the Murder of <i>John Armstrong</i>, and, in our Journey
here, we had Conference with our Cousins the <i>Delawares</i> about it, and
reproved them severely for it, and charged them to go down to our
Brother <i>Onas</i>, and make him Satisfaction, both for the Men that were
killed, and for the Goods. We understood, by them, that the principal
Actor in these Murders is in your Prison, and that he had done all the
Mischief himself; but that besides him, you had required and demanded
two others who were in his Company when the Murders were committed. We
promise faithfully, in our Return, to renew our Reproofs, and to charge
the <i>Delawares</i> to send down some of their Chiefs with these two young
Men (but not as Prisoners) to be examined by you; and as we think, upon
Examination, you will not find them guilty, we rely on your Justice not
to do them any Harm, but to permit them to return home in Safety.</p>

<p>We likewise understand, that Search has been made for the Goods
belonging to the Deceased, and that some have been already returned to
your People, but that some are still missing. You may depend upon our
giving the strictest Charge to the <i>Delawares</i> to search again with more
Diligence for the Goods, and to return them, or the Value of them, in
Skins. And, to confirm what we have said, we give you this String of
Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremonies</i>.</div>

<p><i>Brother</i> Onas,</p>

<p>The <i>Conoy Indians</i> have informed us, that they sent you a Message, some
Time ago, to advise you, that they were ill used by the white People in
the Place where they had lived, and that they had come to a Resolution
of removing to <i>Shamokin</i>, and requested some small Satisfaction for
their Land; and as they never have received any Answer from you, they
have desired us to speak for them; we heartily recommend their Case to
your Generosity. And, to give Weight to our Recommendation, we present
you with this String of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremony</i>.</div>

<p><i>The Governor having conferred a little Time with the honourable
Commissioners of</i> Virginia <i>and</i> Maryland, <i>made the following Reply</i>:</p>

<p><i>Brethren</i>,</p>

<p>I am glad to find that you agree with me in the Necessity of keeping the
Road between us clear and open, and the Concern you have expressed on
account of the barbarous Murders mentioned to you, is a Proof of your
Brotherly Affection for us. If Crimes of this Nature be not strictly
enquired into, and the Criminals severely punished, there will be an End
of all Commerce between us and the <i>Indians</i>, and then you will be
altogether in the Power of the <i>French</i>. They will set what Price they
please on their own Goods, and give you what they think fit for your
Skins; so it is for your own Interest that our Traders should be safe in
their Persons and Goods when they travel to your Towns.</p>

<p><i>Brethren</i>,</p>

<p>I considered this Matter well before I came from <i>Philadelphia</i>, and I
advised with the Council there upon it, as I have done here with the
honourable the Commissioners of <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i>. I never heard
before of the Murder of the three <i>Indians</i> at <i>Ohio</i>; had Complaint
been made to me of it, and it had appeared to have been committed by any
of the People under my Government, they should have been put to Death,
as two of them were, some Years ago, for killing two <i>Indians</i>. You are
not to take your own Satisfaction, but to apply to me, and I will see
that Justice be done you; and should any of the <i>Indians</i> rob or murder
any of our People, I do expect that you will deliver them up to be tried
and punished in the same Manner as white People are. This is the Way to
preserve Friendship between us, and will be for your Benefit as well as
ours. I am well pleased with the Steps you have already taken, and the
Reproofs you have given to your Cousins the <i>Delawares</i>, and do expect
you will lay your Commands upon some of their Chiefs to bring down the
two young Men that were present at the Murders; if they are not brought
down, I shall look upon it as a Proof of their Guilt.</p>

<p>If, upon Examination, they shall be found not to have been concerned in
the bloody Action, they shall be well used, and sent home in Safety: I
will take it upon myself to see that they have no Injustice done them.
An Inventory is taken of the Goods already restored, and I expect
Satisfaction will be made for such as cannot be found, in Skins,
according to Promise.</p>

<p>I well remember the coming down of one of the <i>Conoy Indians</i> with a
Paper, setting forth, That the <i>Conoys</i> had come to a Resolution to
leave the Land reserved for them by the Proprietors, but he made no
Complaint to me of ill Usage from the white People. The Reason he gave
for their Removal was, That the settling of the white People all round
them had made Deer scarce, and that therefore they chose to remove to
<i>Juniata</i> for the Benefit of Hunting. I ordered what they said to be
entered in the Council-Book. The old Man's Expences were born, and a
Blanket given him at his Return home. I have not yet heard from the
Proprietors on this Head; but you may be assured, from the Favour and
Justice they have always shewn to the <i>Indians</i>, that they will do every
thing that may be reasonably expected of them in this Case.</p>

Chamber at <i>Lancaster</i>, <i>July</i> 2, 1744, <i>P. M.</i></h4>

<h4><span class="gesperrt">PRESENT</span>,</h4>

The Honourable the Commissioners of <i>Virginia</i>.<br />

The Deputies of the <i>Six Nations</i>.<br />

<i>Conrad Weiser</i>, Interpreter.<br />

<p><i>The</i> Indians <i>being told, by the Interpreter, that their Brother</i>
Assaragoa <i>was going to speak to them, the Commissioners spoke as
follows</i>:</p>

<p><i>Sachems and Warriors, our Friends and Brethren</i>,</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>s we have already said enough to you on the Subject of the Title to the
Lands you claim from <i>Virginia</i>, we have no Occasion to say any thing
more to you on that head, but come directly to the Point.</p>

<p>We have opened the Chest, and the Goods are now here before you; they
cost Two Hundred Pounds <i>Pensylvania</i> Money, and were bought by a Person
recommended to us by the Governor of <i>Pensylvania</i> with ready Cash. We
ordered them to be good in their Kinds, and we believe they are so.
These Goods, and Two Hundred Pounds in Gold, which lie on the Table, we
will give you, our Brethren of the <i>Six Nations</i>, upon Condition that
you immediately make a Deed recognizing the King's Right to all the
Lands that are, or shall be, by his Majesty's Appointment in the Colony
of <i>Virginia</i>.</p>

<p>As to the Road, we agree you shall have one, and the Regulation is in
Paper, which the Interpreter now has in his Custody to shew you. The
People of <i>Virginia</i> shall perform their Part, if you and your <i>Indians</i>
perform theirs; we are your Brethren, and will do no Hardships to you,
but, on the contrary, all the Kindness we can."</p>

<p>The <i>Indians</i> agreed to what was said, and <i>Canassatego</i> desired they
would represent their Case to the King, in order to have a further
Consideration when the Settlement increased much further back. To which
the Commissioners agreed, and promised they would make such a
Representation faithfully and honestly; and, for their further Security
that they would do so, they would give them a Writing, under their Hands
and Seals, to that Purpose.</p>

<p>They desired that some Rum might be given them to drink on their Way
home, which the Commissioners agreed to, and paid them in Gold for that
Purpose, and the Carriage of their Goods from <i>Philadelphia</i>, Nine
Pounds Thirteen Shillings, and Three-pence, <i>Pensylvania</i> Money.</p>

<p><i>Canassatego</i> further said, That as their Brother <i>Tocarry-hogan</i> sent
them provision on the Road here, which kept them from starving, he hoped
their Brother <i>Assaragoa</i> would do the same for them back, and have the
Goods he gave them carried to the usual Place; which the Commissioners
agreed to, and ordered Provisions and Carriages to be provided
accordingly.</p>

<p>After this Conference the Deed was produced, and the Interpreter
explained it to them; and they, according to their Rank and Quality,
put their Marks and Seals to it in the Presence of several Gentlemen of
<i>Maryland, Pensylvania</i> and <i>Virginia</i>; and when they delivered the
Deed, <i>Canassatego</i> delivered it for the Use of their Father, the Great
King, and hoped he would consider them; on which the Gentlemen and
<i>Indians</i> then present gave three Shouts.</p>

<h4>In the <span class="smcap"><span class="gesperrt">Court-House</span></span>
at <i>Lancaster, Tuesday</i>, <i>July</i> 3, 1744, <i>A. M.</i></h4>

<h4><span class="gesperrt">PRESENT</span>,</h4>

The Honourable <i><span class="gesperrt">GEORGE THOMAS</span></i>, Esq; Governor, &amp;c.<br />

The Honourable the Commissioners of <i>Virginia</i>.<br />

The Honourable the Commissioners of <i>Maryland</i>.<br />

The Deputies of the <i>Six Nations</i>.<br />

<i>Conrad Weiser</i>, Interpreter.<br />
<br />
<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Governor</span> <i>spoke as follows</i>:<br />

<p><i>Friends and Brethren of the</i> Six Nations,</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>t a Treaty held with many of the Chiefs of your Nations Two Years ago,
the Road between us was made clearer and wider; our Fire was enlarged,
and our Friendship confirmed by an Exchange of Presents, and many other
mutual good Offices.</p>

<p>We think ourselves happy in having been instrumental to your meeting
with our Brethren of <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i>; and we persuade
ourselves, that you, on your Parts, will always remember it as an
instance of our Good-will and Affection for you. This has given us an
Opportunity of seeing you sooner than perhaps we should otherwise have
done; and, as we are under mutual Obligations by Treaties, we to hear
with our Ears for you, and you to hear with your Ears for us, we take
this Opportunity to inform you of what very nearly concerns us both.</p>

<p>The <i>great King of</i> <span class="smcap">England</span> and the <i>French</i> King have declared War
against each other. Two Battles have been fought, one by Land, and the
other by Sea. The <i>great King of</i> <span class="smcap">England</span> commanded the Land-Army in
Person, and gained a compleat Victory. Numbers of the <i>French</i> were
killed and taken Prisoners, and the rest were forced to pass a River
with Precipitation to save their Lives. The Great God covered the King's
Head in that Battle, so that he did not receive the least Hurt; for
which you, as well as we, have Reason to be very thankful.</p>

<p>The Engagement at Sea was likewise to the Advantage of the <i>English</i>.
The <i>French</i> and <i>Spaniards</i> joined their Ships together, and came out
to fight us. The brave <i>English</i> Admiral burnt one of their largest
Ships, and many others were so shattered, that they were glad to take
the Opportunity of a very high Wind, and a dark Night, to run away, and
to hide themselves again in their own Harbours. Had the Weather proved
fair, he would, in all Probability, have taken or destroyed them all.</p>

<p>I need not put you in mind how much <i>William Penn</i> and his Sons have
been your Friends, and the Friends of all the <i>Indians</i>. You have long
and often experienced their Friendship for you; nor need I repeat to you
how kindly you were treated, and what valuable Presents were made to you
two Years ago by the Governor, the Council, and the Assembly of
<i>Pensylvania</i>. The Sons of <i>William Penn</i> are all now in <i>England</i>, and
have left me in their Place, well knowing how much I regard you and all
the <i>Indians</i>. As a fresh Proof of this, I have left my House, and am
come thus far to see you, to renew our Treaties, to brighten the
Covenant-Chain, and to confirm our Friendship with you. In Testimony
whereof, I present you with this Belt of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the</i> Yo-hah.</div>

<p>As your Nations have engaged themselves by Treaty to assist us, your
Brethren of <i>Pensylvania</i>, in case of a War with the <i>French</i>, we do not
doubt but you will punctually perform an Engagement so solemnly entered
into. A War is now declared, and we expect that you will not suffer the
<i>French</i>, or any of the <i>Indians</i> in Alliance with them, to march
through your Country to disturb any of our Settlements; and that you
will give us the earliest and best Intelligence of any Designs that may
be formed by them to our Disadvantage, as we promise to do of any that
may be to yours. To enforce what I have now said to you in the strongest
Manner, I present you with this Belt of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the</i> Yo-hah.</div>

<p><i>After a little Pause his Honour, the</i> <span class="smcap">Governor</span>, <i>spoke again</i>:</p>

<p><i>Friends and Brethren of the</i> Six Nations,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> I have now said to you is in Conformity to Treaties subsisting
between the Province of which I am Governor and your Nations. I now
proceed, with the Consent of the honourable Commissioners for <i>Virginia</i>
and <i>Maryland</i>, to tell you, that all Differences having been adjusted,
and the Roads between us and you made quite clear and open, we are ready
to confirm our Treaties with your Nations, and establish a Friendship
that is not to end, but with the World itself. And, in Behalf of the
Province of <i>Pensylvania</i>, I do, by this fine Belt of Wampum, and a
Present of Goods, to the Value of three hundred Pounds, confirm and
establish the said Treaties of Peace, Union and Friendship, you on your
Parts doing the same.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with a loud</i> Yo-hah.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Governor further added, The Goods bought with the one hundred Pounds
Sterling, put into my Hands by the Governor of <i>Virginia</i>, are ready to
be delivered when you please. The Goods bought and sent up by the People
of the Province of <i>Pensylvania</i>, according to the List which the
Interpreter will explain, are laid by themselves, and are likewise ready
to be delivered to you at your own time.</p>

<p><i>After a little Pause the Commissioners of</i> Virginia <i>spoke as follows</i>:</p>

<p><i>Sachems and Warriors of the</i> Six Nations,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Way between us being made smooth by what passed Yesterday, we desire
now to confirm all former Treaties made between <i>Virginia</i> and you, our
Brethren of the <i>Six Nations</i>, and to make our Chain of Union and
Friendship as bright as the Sun, that it may not contract any more Rust
for ever; that our Childrens Children may rejoice at, and confirm what
we have done; and that you and your Children may not forget it, we give
you one hundred Pounds in Gold, and this Belt of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremony</i>.</div>

<p><i>Friends and Brethren</i>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Altho</span>' we have been disappointed in our Endeavours to bring about a
Peace between you and the <i>Catawbas</i>, yet we desire to speak to you
something more about them. We believe they have been unfaithful to you,
and spoke of you with a foolish Contempt; but this may be only the
Rashness of some of their young Men. In this Time of War with our
common Enemies the <i>French</i> and <i>Spaniards</i>, it will be the wisest way
to be at Peace among ourselves. They, the <i>Catawbas</i>, are also Children
of the great King, and therefore we desire you will agree, that we may
endeavour to make a Peace between you and them, that we may be all
united by one common Chain of Friendship. We give you this String of
Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremony</i>.</div>

<p><i>Brethren</i>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> Friend, <i>Conrad Weiser</i>, when he is old, will go into the other
World, as our Fathers have done, our Children will then want such a
Friend to go between them and your Children, to reconcile any
Differences that may happen to arise between them, that, like him, may
have the Ears and Tongues of our Children and yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Way to have such a Friend, is for you to send three or four of your
Boys to <i>Virginia</i>, where we have a fine House for them to live in, and
a Man on purpose to teach the Children of you, our Friends, the
Religion, Language and Customs of the white People. To this Place we
kindly invite you to send some of your Children; and we promise you they
shall have the same Care taken of them, and be instructed in the same
Manner as our own Children, and be returned to you again when you
please; and, to confirm this, we give you this String of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremony</i>.</div>

<p><i>Then the Commissioners of</i> Maryland <i>spoke as follows</i>:</p>

<p><i>Friends and Brethren, the Chiefs or Sachems of the</i> Six <i>united</i>
Nations,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Governor of <i>Maryland</i> invited you hither, we have treated you as
Friends, and agreed with you as Brethren.</p>

<p>As the Treaty now made concerning the Lands in <i>Maryland</i> will, we hope,
prevent effectually every future Misunderstanding between us on that
Account, we will now bind faster the Links of our Chain of Friendship,
by a Renewal of all our former Treaties; and that they may still be the
better secured, we shall present you with one hundred Pounds in Gold.</p>

<p>What we have further to say to you is, Let not our Chain contract any
Rust; whenever you perceive the least Speck, tell us of it, and we will
make it clean. This we also expect of you, that it may always continue
so bright as our Generations may see their Faces in it; and, in Pledge
of the Truth of what we have now spoken, and our Affection to you, we
give you this Belt of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremony.</i></div>

<p><i><span class="gesperrt">CANASSATEGO</span>, in return, spoke as follows</i>:</p>

<p><i>Brother</i> Onas, Assaragoa, <i>and</i> Tocarry-hogan,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> return you Thanks for your several Speeches, which are very agreeable
to us. They contain Matters of such great Moment, that we propose to
give them a very serious Consideration, and to answer them suitably to
their Worth and Excellence; and this will take till to-morrow Morning,
and when we are ready we will give you due Notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> tell us you beat the <i>French</i>; if so, you must have taken a great
deal of Rum from them, and can the better spare us some of that Liquor
to make us rejoice with you in the Victory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Governor and Commissioners ordered a Dram of Rum to be given to each
in a small Glass, calling it, <i>A French Glass</i>.</p>

<i><span class="gesperrt">CANASSATEGO</span> Speaker.</i><br />

<p><i>Brother</i> Onas,</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>esterday</span> you expressed your Satisfaction in having been instrumental to
our meeting with our Brethren of <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i>, we, in
return, assure you, that we have great Pleasure in this Meeting, and
thank you for the Part you have had in bringing us together, in order to
create a good Understanding, and to clear the Road; and, in Token of our
Gratitude, we present you with this String of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremony.</i></div>

<p><i>Brother</i> Onas,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> was pleased Yesterday to inform us, "That War had been declared
between <i>the great King of</i> <span class="smcap">England</span> and the <i>French</i> King; that two
great Battles had been fought, one by Land, and the other at Sea; with
many other Particulars." We are glad to hear the Arms of the King of
<i>England</i> were successful, and take part with you in your Joy on this
Occasion. You then came nearer Home, and told us, "You had left your
House, and were come thus far on Behalf of the whole People of
<i>Pensylvania</i> to see us; to renew your Treaties, to brighten the
Covenant-Chain, and to confirm your Friendship with us." We approve
this Proposition, we thank you for it. We own, with Pleasure, that the
Covenant-Chain between us and <i>Pensylvania</i> is of old Standing, and has
never contracted any Rust; we wish it may always continue as bright as
it has done hitherto; and, in Token of the Sincerity of our Wishes, we
present you with this Belt of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the</i> Yo-hah.</div>

<p><i>Brother Onas</i>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> was pleased Yesterday to remind us of our mutual Obligation to
assist each other in case of a War with the <i>French</i>, and to repeat the
Substance of what we ought to do by our Treaties with you; and that as a
War had been already entered into with the <i>French</i>, you called upon us
to assist you, and not to suffer the <i>French</i> to march through our
Country to disturb any of your Settlements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> answer, we assure you we have all these Particulars in our Hearts,
they are fresh in our Memory. We shall never forget that you and we have
but one Heart, one Head, one Eye, one Ear, and one Hand. We shall have
all your Country under our Eye, and take all the Care we can to prevent
any Enemy from coming into it; and, in proof of our Care, we must inform
you, that before we came here, we told <i>Onandio</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, our Father, as he
is called, that neither he, nor any of his People, should come through
our Country, to hurt our Brethren the <i>English</i>, or any of the
Settlements belonging to them; there was Room enough at Sea to fight,
there he might do what he pleased, but he should not come upon our Land
to do any Damage to our Brethren. And you may depend upon our using our
utmost Care to see this effectually done; and, in Token of our
Sincerity, we present you with this Belt of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremony.</i></div>

<p><i>After some little Time the Interpreter said</i>, Canassatego <i>had forgot
something material, and desired to mend his Speech, and to do so as
often as he should omit any thing of Moment, and thereupon he added:</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Six Nations</i> have a great Authority and Influence over sundry
Tribes of <i>Indians</i> in Alliance with the <i>French</i>, and particularly over
the <i>Praying Indians</i>, formerly a Part with ourselves, who stand in the
very Gates of the <i>French</i>; and, to shew our further Care, we have
engaged these very <i>Indians</i>, and other <i>Indian</i> Allies of the <i>French</i>
for you. They will not join the <i>French</i> against you. They have
agreed with us before we set out. We have put the Spirit of Antipathy
against the <i>French</i> in those People. Our Interest is very considerable
with them, and many other Nations, and as far as ever it extends, we
shall use it for your Service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Governor said, <i>Canassatego</i> did well to mend his Speech; he might
always do it whenever his Memory should fail him in any Point of
Consequence, and he thanked him for the very agreeable Addition.</p>

<p><i>Brother</i> Assaragoa,</p>

<p>You told us Yesterday, that all Disputes with you being now at an end,
you desired to confirm all former Treaties between <i>Virginia</i> and us,
and to make our Chain of Union as bright as the Sun.</p>

<p>We agree very heartily with you in these Propositions; we thank you for
your good Inclinations; we desire you will pay no Regard to any idle
Stories that may be told to our Prejudice. And, as the Dispute about the
Land is now intirely over, and we perfectly reconciled, we hope, for the
future, we shall not act towards each other but as becomes Brethren and
hearty Friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are very willing to renew the Friendship with you, and to make it as
firm as possible, for us and our Children with you and your Children to
the latest Generation, and we desire you will imprint these Engagements
on your Hearts in the strongest Manner; and, in Confirmation that we
shall do the same, we give you this Belt of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with</i> Yo-hah <i>from the Interpreter, and all the Nations</i>.</div>

<p><i>Brother</i> Assaragoa,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> did let us know Yesterday, that tho' you had been disappointed in
your Endeavours to bring about a Peace between us and the <i>Catawbas</i>,
yet you would still do the best to bring such a Thing about. We are well
pleased with your Design, and the more so, as we hear you know what sort
of People the <i>Catawbas</i> are, that they are spiteful and offensive, and
have treated us contemptuously. We are glad you know these Things of the
<i>Catawbas</i>; we believe what you say to be true, that there are,
notwithstanding, some amongst them who are wiser and better; and, as you
say, they are your Brethren, and belong to the great King over the
Water, we shall not be against a Peace on reasonable Terms, provided
they will come to the Northward to treat about it. In Confirmation of
what we say, and to encourage you in your Undertaking, we give you this
String of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremonies</i>.</div>

<p><i>Brother</i> Assaragoa,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> told us likewise, you had a great House provided for the Education
of Youth, and that there were several white People and <i>Indians</i>
Children there to learn Languages, and to write and read, and invited us
to send some of our Children amongst you, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> must let you know we love our Children too well to send them so great
a Way, and the <i>Indians</i> are not inclined to give their Children
Learning. We allow it to be good, and we thank you for your Invitation;
but our Customs differing from yours, you will be so good as to excuse
us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> hope <i>Tarachawagon</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> will be preserved by the good Spirit to a good
old Age; when he is gone under Ground, it will be then time enough to
look out for another; and no doubt but amongst so many Thousands as
there are in the World, one such Man may be found, who will serve both
Parties with the same Fidelity as <i>Tarachawagon</i> does; while he lives
there is no Room to complain. In Token of our Thankfulness for your
Invitation, we give you this String of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Ceremony</i>.</div>

<p><i>Brother</i> Tocarry-hogan,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> told us Yesterday, that since there was now nothing in Controversy
between us, and the Affair of the Land was settled to your Satisfaction,
you would now brighten the Chain of Friendship which hath subsisted
between you and us ever since we became Brethren; we are well pleased
with the Proposition, and we thank you for it; we also are inclined to
renew all Treaties, and keep a good Correspondence with you. You told us
further, if ever we should perceive the Chain had contracted any Rust,
to let you know, and you would take care to take the Rust out, and
preserve it bright. We agree with you in this, and shall, on our Parts,
do every thing to preserve a good Understanding, and to live in the same
Friendship with you as with our Brother <i>Onas</i> and <i>Assaragoa</i>; in
Confirmation whereof we give you this Belt of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>On which the usual Cry of</i> Yo-hah <i>was given</i>.</div>

<p><i>Brethren</i>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have now finished our Answer to what you said to us Yesterday, and
shall now proceed to <i>Indian</i> Affairs, that are not of so general a
Concern.</p>

<p><i>Brother</i> Assaragoa,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> lives a Nation of <i>Indians</i> on the other Side of your Country, the
<i>Tuscaroraes</i>, who are our Friends, and with whom we hold
Correspondence; but the Road between us and them has been stopped for
some Time, on account of the Misbehaviour of some of our Warriors. We
have opened a new Road for our Warriors, and they shall keep to that;
but as that would be inconvenient for Messengers going to the
<i>Tuscaroraes</i>, we desire they may go the old Road. We frequently send
Messengers to one another, and shall have more Occasion to do so now
that we have concluded a Peace with the <i>Cherikees</i>. To enforce our
Request, we give you this String of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Cry of Approbation</i>.</div>

<p><i>Brother</i> Assaragoa,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> these <i>Tuscaroraes</i> there live a few Families of the <i>Conoy
Indians</i>, who are desirous to leave them, and to remove to the rest of
their Nation among us, and the strait Road from them to us lies through
the Middle of your Country. We desire you will give them free Passage
through <i>Virginia</i>, and furnish them with Passes; and, to enforce our
Request, we give you this String of Wampum.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Which was received with the usual Cry of Approbation</i>.</div>

<p><i>Brother</i> Onas, Assaragoa, <i>and</i> Tocarry-hogan,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the Close of your respective Speeches Yesterday, you made us very
handsome Presents, and we should return you something suitable to your
Generosity; but, alas! we are poor, and shall ever remain so, as long as
there are so many <i>Indian</i> Traders among us. Theirs and the white
Peoples Cattle have eat up all the Grass, and make Deer scarce. However,
we have provided a small Present for you, and though some of you gave us
more than others, yet, as you are all equally our Brethren, we shall
leave it to you to divide it as you please.&mdash;And then presented three
Bundles of Skins, which were received with the usual Ceremony from the
three Governments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have one Thing further to say; and that is, We heartily recommend
Union and a good Agreement between you our Brethren. Never disagree, but
preserve a strict Friendship for one another, and thereby you, as well
as we, will become the stronger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> wise Forefathers established Union and Amity between the <i>Five
Nations</i>; this has made us formidable; this has given us great Weight
and Authority with our neighbouring Nations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are a powerful Confederacy; and, by your observing the same Methods
our wise Forefathers have taken, you will acquire fresh Strength and
Power; therefore whatever befals you, never fall out one with another.</p>

<p>The Governor replied:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> honourable Commissioners of <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i> have desired
me to speak for them; therefore I, in Behalf of those Governments, as
well as of the Province of <i>Pensylvania</i>, return you Thanks for the many
Proofs you have given in your Speeches of your Zeal for the Service of
your Brethren the <i>English</i>, and in particular for your having so early
engaged in a Neutrality the several Tribes of <i>Indians</i> in the <i>French</i>
Alliance. We do not doubt but you will faithfully discharge your
Promises. As to your Presents, we never estimate these Things by their
real Worth, but by the Disposition of the Giver. In this Light we accept
them with great Pleasure, and put a high Value upon them. We are obliged
to you for recommending Peace and good Agreement amongst ourselves. We
are all Subjects, as well as you, of the great King beyond the Water;
and, in Duty to his Majesty, and from the good Affection we bear to each
other, as well as from a Regard to our own Interest, we shall always be
inclined to live in Friendship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> the Commissioners of <i>Virginia</i> presented the hundred Pounds in
Gold, together with a Paper, containing a Promise to recommend the <i>Six
Nations</i> for further Favour to the King; which they received with
<i>Yo-hah</i>, and the Paper was given by them to <i>Conrad Weiser</i> to keep for
them. The Commissioners likewise promised that their publick Messengers
should not be molested in their Passage through <i>Virginia</i>, and that
they would prepare Passes for such of the <i>Conoy Indians</i> as were
willing to remove to the Northward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> the Commissioners of <i>Maryland</i> presented their hundred Pounds in
Gold, which was likewise received with the <i>Yo-hah</i>.</p>

<p><i>Canassatego</i> said, We mentioned to you Yesterday the Booty you had
taken from the <i>French</i>, and asked you for some of the Rum which we
supposed to be Part of it, and you gave us some; but it turned out
unfortunately that you gave it in <i>French</i> Glasses, we now desire you
will give us some in <i>English</i> Glasses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Governor made answer, We are glad to hear you have such a Dislike
for what is <i>French</i>. They cheat you in your Glasses, as well as in
every thing else. You must consider we are at a Distance from
<i>Williamsburg, Annapolis</i>, and <i>Philadelphia</i>, where our Rum Stores are,
and that although we brought up a good Quantity with us, you have
almost drunk it out; but, notwithstanding this, we have enough left to
fill our <i>English</i> Glasses, and will shew the Difference between the
Narrowness of the <i>French</i>, and the Generosity of your Brethren the
<i>English</i> towards you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Indians</i> gave, in their Order, five <i>Yo-hahs</i>; and the honourable
Governor and Commissioners calling for some Rum, and some middle-sized
Wine-Glasses, drank Health to the <i>great King of</i> <span class="smcap">England</span>, and the <i>Six
Nations</i>, and put an end to the Treaty by three loud Huzza's, in which
all the Company joined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Evening the Governor went to take his Leave of the <i>Indians</i>,
and, presenting them with a String of Wampum, he told them, that was in
return for one he had received of them, with a Message to desire the
Governor of <i>Virginia</i> to suffer their Warriors to go through <i>Virginia</i>
unmolested, which was rendered unnecessary by the present Treaty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span>, presenting them with another String of Wampum, he told them, that
was in return for theirs, praying him, that as they had taken away one
Part of <i>Conrad Weiser</i>'s Beard, which frightened their Children, he
would please to take away the other, which he had ordered to be done.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>The</i> Indians <i>received these two Strings of Wampum with the usual Yo-hah</i>.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Governor then asked them, what was the Reason that more of the
<i>Shawanaes</i>, from their Town on <i>Hohio</i>, were not at the Treaty? But
seeing that it would require a Council in Form, and perhaps another Day
to give an Answer, he desired they would give an Answer to <i>Conrad
Weiser</i> upon the Road on their Return home, for he was to set out for
<i>Philadelphia</i> the next Morning.</p>

<p><i><span class="gesperrt">CANASSATEGO</span> in Conclusion spoke at follows:</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have been hindered, by a great deal of Business, from waiting on you,
to have some private Conversation with you, chiefly to enquire after the
Healths of <i>Onas</i> beyond the Water; we desire you will tell them, we
have a grateful Sense of all their Kindnesses for the <i>Indians</i>. Brother
<i>Onas</i> told us, when he went away, he would not stay long from us; we
think it is a great while, and want to know when we may expect him, and
desire, when you write, you will recommend us heartily to him; which the
Governor promised to do, and then took his Leave of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Commissioners of <i>Virginia</i> gave <i>Canassatego</i> a Scarlet Camblet
Coat, and took their Leave of them in Form, and at the same time
delivered the Passes to them, according to their Request.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Commissioners of <i>Maryland</i> presented <i>Gachradodow</i> with a broad
Gold-laced Hat, and took their Leave of them in the same Manner.</p>

<h3><i>A</i>&nbsp; <span class="gesperrt">TREATY</span>&nbsp; <i>between
his Excellency the Governor of the Province of</i> New-York, <i>and
the</i> Six Nations, <i>and other</i> Indian <i>Nations, depending on said Province.</i></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t is well known in the Province of <i>New-York</i>, that the <i>Six Nations</i>
of <i>Indians</i> depending on this Province, (called <i>Iroquois</i> by the
<i>French</i>) had lately on several Occasions, appear'd dissatisfied and
wavering in their Fidelity to the <i>British</i> Crown. No doubt, this was
principally occasion'd by the Artifices of the <i>French</i> of <i>Canada</i>, who
had constantly Emissaries among them: But at the same Time there is
Reason to think, the suspicious Behaviour of these Nations, in Favour of
their once inveterate Enemy the <i>French</i>, could not have arriv'd to the
Pitch it did, otherwise than by some Neglects or Misconduct of those who
were entrusted by the Government of <i>New-York</i> with the Management of
the <i>Indian</i> Affairs.</p>

<p>His Excellency the Governor of <i>New-York</i>, having received his Majesty's
Commands, to engage the <i>Indian</i> Nations depending on his Government, to
join in the Expedition then intended against <i>Canada</i>, and to make them
the usual Presents on that Occasion; and being sensible of the great Use
these <i>Nations</i> might be to the Success of this Enterprize, and likewise
of the Difficulties that probably might attend his Endeavours at this
Time, was desirous to have had the Assistance of as many of the Members
of his Majesty's Council as the Circumstances of Affairs would permit;
but they all declined to give their Attendance, except Mr. <i>Colden</i> and
Mr. <i>Livingston</i>. His Excellency was therefore obliged to act with the
smallest Number of Members, which by his Majesty's Commission can form a
Council, <i>viz</i>. Three; the above two Gentlemen and Capt. <i>Rutherford</i>,
who was then at his Post in <i>Albany</i>.</p>

<p>As soon as his Excellency received his Majesty's Commands, he dispatched
from <i>Albany</i> such Persons as, by the best Information he could receive,
had Influence among the <i>Six Nations</i>, to invite them severally to meet
him at <i>Albany</i>, on the 20th of <i>July</i>. His Excellency arriv'd at
<i>Albany</i> the 21st of <i>July</i>, where having heard, that, besides the
Small-Pox, (which his Excellency never had) many were sick of a
contagious malignant Fever, he continued on board the Sloop which
carried him up, to consider where to lodge with the least Danger to his
Person from the Infection of these Distempers; and the next Morning
resolved to go into the Fort. He was received at his Landing with the
usual Marks of Respect from the Corporation, the independent Companies
of regular Troops then in the Place, and the Militia, under a Discharge
of the Cannon of the Fort and Town.</p>

<p>In the Afternoon of the same Day on which his Excellency came on shore,
three <i>Indians, viz</i>. two <i>Onandagos</i> and an <i>Oneydo</i>, brought two
<i>French</i> Scalps and presented to his Excellency: At which Time the
Leader of the Party made a formal Speech to the following Purpose: 'That
having had repeated Accounts of the Mischiefs done by the <i>French</i>, and
of the frequent Murders committed by them, and that the <i>Mohawks</i>,
notwithstanding their Professions of Friendship, suffered this Bloodshed
to remain unrevenged, his Heart could bear it no longer; he thereupon
resolved to open for his Brethren the Path to Revenge: That these two
Scalps which he now presented were taken at Noonday in sight of the
<i>French</i> Fort at <i>Crown Point</i>.' His Excellency told him how well he
took this special Mark of his Fidelity, and assured him, that he would
not only now reward him and his Companions, by particular Presents, but
would always remember this Act of Friendship. They had already received
the Reward given by the Act of Assembly. His Excellency gave each of
them four <i>Spanish</i> Dollars; to the Leader a fine laced Coat and Hat,
and a silver Breast-Plate; and to each of the others a Stroud Blanket
and lac'd Hat.</p>

<p>These <i>Indians</i> told us, that they lay several Days among the Bushes,
from whence they could see every Man that came out of the Fort-Gate.
They endeavoured for some time to take a Prisoner, but observing that
none went to such a Distance from the Fort that they could hope to carry
him off, they resolved to take the first Opportunity for a Scalp: Two
Soldiers coming out of the Fort, after the Chapel Bell had rung about
Noon, one of the <i>Indians</i>, by their Leader's Order, fired with Swan
Shot upon them while they were near to each other. It is a constant Rule
among these sculking Parties, never to fire without Orders from their
Leader. One of the <i>French</i> Men was killed upon the Spot, the other
wounded, and fled immediately towards the Fort Gate, the <i>Indian</i> who
had fired, pursu'd, and with his Hatchet brought him down within a
hundred Steps of the Fort Gate; and, though the <i>French</i> in the Fort
rushed out at the Gate, he took his Scalp off; the others had scalped
the Man that was first killed, and then they all fled. The <i>French</i> in
their Hurry had run out without their Arms, and upon recollecting
themselves return'd to arm, which facilitated the Escape of the
<i>Indians</i>.</p>

<p>His Excellency being informed, that the Leader of this Party was
desirous to be distinguished by his Excellency's giving him a new Name,
and that a Name, which in the Language of the <i>Six Nations</i> signified
the <i>Path-opener</i>, would be most acceptable to him; his Excellency
honour'd him with that Title; which he accepted very thankfully, and
seem'd exceedingly pleased with it: Whereupon he said, that the other
two <i>Indians</i> having associated with a <i>Mehikander</i>, or <i>River Indian</i>,
were resolved to go out against the Enemy: But as he thought he might be
more useful by staying, to assist at the ensuing Treaty, he was resolved
to remain here. He added, that in case the Interpreter, and others sent
to invite the <i>Six Nations</i> to meet here, fail'd in any Part, he would
go among the <i>Six Nations</i>, and doubted not to bring many by his
Influence, who otherwise might stay.</p>

<p>In a Day or two after, six of seven <i>Indians</i>, who had been sent out by
the Commissioners for <i>Indian</i> Affairs to <i>Crown-Point</i>, to take
Prisoners, and gain Intelligence, returned and said, That they had gone
to that Place, and that in sight of it they had separated, with, Design
thereby to surprize any Stragler that might have come out of the Fort:
That while they were thus separated, two of their Number were suddenly
surrounded and taken by the Enemy: One of these two, after having been
detained three or four Days, join'd the others at <i>Saraghtoga</i>. He said,
that he had been threatened with death by the <i>Adirondacks</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; but that
the <i>Cahnuagas</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> interpos'd, and by their Intercession he was set at
Liberty; and some of the <i>Cahnuagas</i> conducted him through <i>Lac
Sacrement</i>. He reported, that there was a great Number of Men, <i>French</i>
and <i>Indians</i>, at <i>Crown-Point.</i> The other Prisoner, an <i>Onondaga</i>,
consented to remain with the <i>French</i>, and was sent to <i>Canada</i>.</p>

<p>Soon after this, sixteen <i>Mohawk Indians</i> came to the Town, who had been
sent out from the lower <i>Mohawk</i> Castle by Mr. <i>Johnson</i>, to gain
Intelligence near <i>Crown-Point</i>, and to take Prisoners. They reported
that they had discovered so great a Number of <i>French</i> and <i>Indians</i> at
<i>Crown-Point</i>, that they had no Hopes of being able to bring off any
Prisoners, and thought it adviseable to return speedily and inform of
the great Danger they thought this Place was in. His Excellency invited
them to go thither again, in order to descry the Motions of the Enemy:
And as a farther Encouragement to them, to either Scalp or take
Prisoners, he offered every Person of said Party that should take a
Scalp or Prisoner, a Piece of Stroud, and a Suit of laced Clothes,
besides the Bounty; but they, being frightened with the Apprehensions of
Danger, declined going back, and said, they must return Home and
acquaint their Friends and Relations with what they had heard and seen.
Several other <i>Indians</i> likewise alarmed the <i>Mohawks</i>, by telling them
that the <i>French</i> had a great Force at <i>Crown-Point</i>, and that they
would certainly attack either <i>Albany</i> or <i>Schenectade</i>, or the
Settlements on the <i>Mohawks</i> River, or perhaps several Places at the
same Time.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Johnson</i>, and the commanding Officer of the Garrison of regular
Troops in the <i>Mohawks</i> Country, by their Letters to his Excellency,
confirm'd these Reports; and added, the <i>Mohawks</i> had entertain'd
Apprehensions of the <i>French</i> Force at <i>Crown-Point</i>, which was like to
have a bad Effect. On this his Excellency wrote to Mr. <i>Johnson</i>, that
all these Stories of the <i>French</i> Force at <i>Crown-Point</i> were only
Artifices of the <i>French</i> to intimidate the <i>Indians</i>, or to amuse them,
with Design to frustrate the Treaty which he intended to have with them;
and that he was to assure the <i>Indians</i>, that they could be in no Danger
from the <i>French:</i> However, that they might see that he would omit
nothing which they might think necessary for their Security, he had
ordered a Lieutenant of Militia, with thirty Men, to reinforce the lower
Castle, and had likewise ordered the Captain of Militia near the upper
Castle, to assist the <i>Indians</i> there in fortifying their Castle, and to
hold himself in Readiness to support them on any Emergency.</p>

<p>One <i>John Colan</i>, a <i>Frenchman</i>, who some Years since had removed from
<i>Canada</i>, and settled and married at <i>Schenectade</i>, and who has since
that Time lived in good Reputation there, was sent by Major <i>Glen</i> to
inform his Excellency, that one <i>Aaron</i>, a noted <i>Mohawk</i> Sachem, who
with several others of the <i>Six Nations</i>, had been last Spring in
<i>Canada</i> to treat with the Governor there, did then entertain two
<i>Cahnuaga Indians</i>. This Man, <i>John Colan</i>, acquainted his Excellency,
that having discovered the <i>Cahnuaga Indians</i>, he told them he was a
<i>Frenchman</i>, and was desirous of returning to his own Country, on which
they began presently to propose to him Methods for his Escape; at which
Time, this <i>Aaron</i> coming near them, he express'd his Fears of being
discovered by him. They answered, that he need not fear <i>Aaron</i>, for he
was their Friend, and designed to go with them. As they proposed to him
to escape privately by himself, and to meet them at a Place they named,
he told them of his Fears, in that Case, of meeting with the <i>French
Indians</i> while he was alone. They answered, that if he dress'd himself
like an <i>Indian</i>, the <i>French Indians</i> would do him no Hurt, without
first calling to him; upon which, if he stopp'd and call'd out <i>Maria</i>,
the <i>French Indians</i> would be so far from hurting him, that they would
immediately come up to him and take him by the Hand. From this, and
several other Incidents, which it would be tedious to relate, his
Excellency was convinced of some secret Understanding between the <i>Six
Nations</i> and the <i>Cahnuagas</i>, or <i>French Indians:</i> And that, however
any Party of our <i>Indians</i> might be induced to fall upon the <i>French</i>,
they would not at that Time molest the <i>French Indians</i>, nor prevent the
Mischiefs which the Inhabitants received from their sculking Parties.</p>

<p>For this Reason, his Excellency endeavoured to send out again the
Company of Rangers, which had formerly been employed against the
sculking <i>Indians:</i> But, as the Assembly had made no Provision for this
Expence, they refused to go, unless he gave his personal Bond for their
Pay, at <i>three Shillings</i> a Day for each private Man, besides their
Provision; and would not be satisfied with the Promises that he, by the
Advice of the Council, made them of recommending their Service to the
General Assembly, and the Assurances he gave them of their being
rewarded as they desired.</p>

<p>On their continuing obstinate, his Excellency was of Opinion, that no
considerable Service could be expected from Men, who were moved by no
other Principle but that of excessive Wages: And he had Reason
afterwards to be confirmed in this Opinion, when Captain <i>Langdon</i>, and
afterwards Captain <i>Thebout</i>, voluntarily went with their Companies of
the new-levied Troops to scour the Woods, and took some of these
<i>Albany</i> Men with them as Guides, who whenever they apprehended
themselves in Danger, by the Discovery of recent Tracts, some one or
other of them could not be kept from firing their Guns, or making some
Noise, by which the <i>French Indians</i>, if any were near them, must know
how to avoid them. Some <i>Indians</i>, who were likewise sent out in Company
with these Men, complained in like Manner.</p>

<p>The publick Interpreter, whom the Governor (as before observed) had sent
with others, to invite the <i>Six Nations</i> to meet him at <i>Albany</i>, wrote
to the Commissioners for <i>Indian</i> Affairs, That they met with great
Difficulties and Obstructions from the <i>Sachems</i>, who had been lately at
<i>Canada:</i> That the <i>Oneydoes</i> refused to give any Answer, tho' they had
staid there thirteen Days endeavouring to persuade them; and that the
<i>Cayugas</i> had absolutely refused to meet the Governor. On which his
Excellency desired to be informed by the Commissioners of <i>Indian</i>
Affairs, whether they knew of any Person of Influence or Interest with
the <i>Indians</i>, and fit to be sent among them on this Occasion. They
answered, that they knew of none; and that the <i>Indians</i> were in a very
bad Disposition, and much under the Influence of the <i>French</i>.</p>

<p>About this time his Excellency being informed, that the Interpreter, and
others sent with him, had neglected to send proper Invitations to the
<i>Indians</i> living on the Branches of <i>Susquehannah</i> River; and that
Captain <i>Vroman</i>, of <i>Scohary</i>, was a proper Person to be sent to those
<i>Indians</i>; he sent him, in Company with Captain <i>Staats</i>, with a Belt of
<i>Wampum</i> to invite them.</p>

<p>While the <i>Indian</i> Affairs appear'd in this discouraging State, an
Account came to Town, that about twenty young <i>Chickesaws</i> were come to
the <i>Senekas</i>, to desire them to shew them the Way to <i>Canada</i>. The
<i>Chickesaws</i> had always been Enemies to the <i>French:</i> A Party of about
five hundred Men had, four Years before, been sent out against them from
<i>Canada</i>, who were so entirely routed by the <i>Chickesaws</i>, that few
returned. These young <i>Chickesaws</i> told the <i>Senekas</i>, that the <i>French</i>
of <i>Canada</i> had, about four Years since, made them a Visit, and were so
kind to leave them four hundred Guns, which were now wore out; and,
since the <i>French</i> had not thought fit to bring them any more Guns, they
were resolved to go to <i>Canada</i> to fetch new ones; and promised, that if
the <i>Senekas</i> would shew them the Way, they would go Home and return
with four hundred stout Fellows. Some other <i>Indian</i> Nations who lived
to the Westward, discovering their Aversion to the <i>French</i> at the same
Time, these Incidents assisted the Governor's Messengers in bringing
more <i>Indians</i> to <i>Albany</i> than they expected, when they wrote to the
Commissioners for <i>Indian</i> Affairs.</p>

<p>While the Interpreter was at the more distant <i>Indian</i> Castles, Mr.
<i>William Johnson</i> was indefatigable among the <i>Mohawks</i>; he dressed
himself after the <i>Indian</i> Manner, made frequent Dances, according to
their Custom when they excite to War, and used all the Means he could
think of, at a considerable Expence, (which his Excellency had promised
to repay him) in order to engage them heartily in the War against
<i>Canada</i>. Tho' he succeeded, beyond what any Man in <i>Albany</i> thought
could be done, yet several of the <i>Sachems</i> (in the <i>Conajohary</i>, or
upper <i>Mohawk</i> Castle, chiefly) refused to engage in the War; but
insisted, that as this War was entered into between the <i>English</i> and
<i>French</i>, in which they had no Interest, they ought to remain neuter.
The <i>English</i> and <i>French</i>, they said, could at any Time make Peace; but
if they should enter into the War, <i>Indians</i> could not make up the
Quarrel among themselves, otherwise than by the Destruction of one or
the other. The <i>French</i> could have no Hopes of engaging the <i>Six
Nations</i> on their Side against the <i>English</i>, and therefore wisely
play'd this Game of endeavouring to make them stand neuter, which they
could enforce by strong political Arguments, of which the <i>Indians</i> were
sensible enough. <i>It is your Interest</i>, the <i>French</i> Emissaries said,
<i>not to suffer either the</i> French <i>or the</i> English <i>to be absolute
Masters</i>; <i>for in that Case you must become Slaves to the one or the
other</i>. From this politic View chiefly, the Interpreter met with so much
Opposition everywhere: Tho' it is not to be doubted, but that at the
same Time the <i>French</i> had gain'd some particular <i>Sachems</i> entirely
into their Interest; however, many were prevailed on to come to
<i>Albany</i>, to hear what the Governor of <i>New-York</i> had to say to them;
tho' several Sachems staid behind. When they of the more distant Nations
came along with the Interpreter to the lower <i>Mohawk</i> Castle, and found
that Mr. <i>Johnson</i> had already engaged many of the young Men there to
join the Army against <i>Canada</i>, the others blamed the <i>Mohawks</i>; telling
them with some Warmth, That they had been very rash in engaging so far.
'They ought, <i>the others said</i>, to have considered that they, the
<i>Mohawks</i>, were the smallest in Number of any of the <i>Six Nations</i>, and
ought not to have proceeded to so great a Length, without the previous
Consent of the others.' To this the <i>Mohawks</i> answered, <i>It is true, we
are less considerable as to Number, than any of the other Nations; but
our Hearts are truly</i> English, <i>and all of us are Men<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>; so that, if
our Force be put to the Trial, perhaps it will be found greater than you
imagine.</i> These Disputes, however, continued so far, that the <i>Mohawks</i>,
and the other <i>Five Nations</i>, could not go in Company to <i>Albany</i>; the
<i>Mohawks</i> marched on one side of the River, while the other Nations went
on the other side. [<i>There are two Roads from the</i> Mohawks <i>Castle to</i>
Schenectada, <i>one on each side of the</i> Mohawks <i>River</i>.]</p>

<p>When the <i>Indians</i> came near the Town of <i>Albany</i>, on the 8<sup>th</sup> of
<i>August</i>, Mr. <i>Johnson</i> put himself at the Head of the <i>Mohawks</i>,
dressed and painted after the Manner of an <i>Indian</i> War-Captain; and the
<i>Indians</i> who followed him, were likewise dressed and painted, as is
usual with them when they set out in War. The <i>Indians</i> saluted the
Governor as they passed the Fort, by a running Fire; which his
Excellency ordered to be answered by a Discharge of some Cannon from the
Fort: He afterwards received the Sachems in the Fort-Hall, bid them
Welcome, and treated them with a Glass of Wine.</p>

<p>As, by all Accounts, the Disposition of the <i>Six Nations</i> seemed at this
Time less in Favour of the <i>British</i> Interest than was to be wished, his
Excellency thought it necessary to have frequent Conferences, in
private, with the principal Sachems of each <i>Nation</i>; sometimes
separately and singly, at other Times with some of each Nation jointly.
There were only two of the <i>Mohawks</i> Sachems (besides <i>Aaron</i> before
mentioned, who left the Castle at this Time) that could not be prevailed
on by Mr. <i>Johnson</i> to declare themselves for entering into the War
against <i>Canada</i>: They were both of the <i>Conajohary</i> or Upper-Castle,
and one of them the Head of the Tribe called the <i>Tortoise</i>; (which,
tho' not so numerous as that of the <i>Bear</i>, yet is looked on as the
first in Rank or Dignity;) and, as he had been with the Governor of
<i>Canada</i> last Spring, it was thought to be of some Consequence to gain
him. Mr. <i>Colden</i>, above twenty Years since, had the Complement of being
received into that Castle; and, about seven Years since (the last Time
he had been with the <i>Mohawks</i>) had contracted some more particular
Acquaintance with these two Sachems: He invited them to a private
Conference, at which the Reverend Mr. <i>Barclay</i> assisted as Interpreter;
they met him, and brought five more with them: After this Conference
these Sachems appear'd as hearty as any of the others. He that was Head
of the Tribe call'd the <i>Tortoise</i>, said, 'His Uncle had been the chief
War-Captain among the <i>Mohawks</i>: That his Uncle had particularly
distinguished himself in their Wars against the <i>French</i>, and he was
resolved to shew himself not unworthy of his Ancestors, nor of his
Uncle's Name, which he had obtained after his Death.'</p>

<p>After the principal Sachems had, at these Conferences, been brought to a
good Disposition, his Excellency advised with the Gentlemen of the
Council, and the Commissioners from the <i>Massachusets Bay</i>, on what
might be proper to be said to the <i>Six Nations</i> in the publick Speech,
which he now proposed to make to them. Col. <i>Wendell</i> and Mr. <i>Wells</i>
had arrived from <i>Boston</i> about the End of <i>July</i>, and soon after they
came to Town, his Excellency ordered the Gentlemen of the Council to
communicate to them all the Information which had been received, with
respect to the <i>Indian</i> Affairs: And they had frequent Conferences
together from Time to Time, as Occasion required: It was likewise
thought proper to communicate, what his Excellency intended to say to
some of the Sachems of each Nation, who were thought most hearty in the
<i>British</i> Interest; who said, that it was well conceiv'd as could have
been done, had they themselves advised upon the Subject; only as it had
been advised to observe in the first Draught, That some of his Majesty's
Subjects had been instigated by the <i>French</i> to rise in Rebellion
against the King; that they had been defeated by one of the King's Sons;
that these poor People were now utterly ruined, and had nothing left but
to bewail their Folly in the Misery that was brought upon them, by
suffering themselves to be deluded by the Promises of the <i>French</i>; they
said, that they did not understand the Affairs on the other Side of the
Sea, nor did they trouble their Heads about them; and as they had no
Method of retaining what is spoke to them but by their Memories, they
were afraid that this might perplex their Memories, and make them less
attentive to what was properly their Business; and advised, that it
should be left out; which accordingly was done.</p>

<p>Another Difficulty remained; the publick Interpreter had been taken
dangerously ill in his Return to <i>Albany</i>, and was at this Time confined
to his Bed. Tho' several were employed, who had Knowledge sufficient in
the Language of the <i>Six Nations</i>, to make themselves be understood, and
to understand what was spoke to them; yet none of them were so much
Masters of the Language, as to speak with that Propriety and
Distinctness that is expected, and usual on so solemn an Occasion. It
was thought therefore proper, to make one of the Sachems understand the
Speech, by the Assistance of the common Interpreters, that he might be
able to deliver it Paragraph by Paragraph, as it should be spoke. At
first a <i>Mohawk</i> Sachem was pitched upon; but the Sachems themselves
told us, That for some time past a kind of Party-Division among the <i>Six
Nations</i> had subsisted: That the <i>Mohawks</i>, <i>Onandagas</i>, and <i>Senekas</i>,
form'd one Party; and the <i>Oneydoes, Tuscaroras</i>, and <i>Cayugas</i>, the
other: That, as the <i>Mohawks</i> might be suspected to be more partial to
the <i>English</i>, it would be of more Use to employ one of the other Party;
and an <i>Oneydo</i> Sachem was proposed for that Purpose. This Man was
easily enough made to understand the Speech, and he repeated it several
Times over in private, and was instructed where to make the proper
Stops. After the Speech was delivered, some of the Commissioners for
<i>Indian</i> Affairs, and other Persons present at the Delivery, who
understood both Languages, acknowledged, that this <i>Indian</i> had
acquitted himself of his Trust faithfully, and had delivered the Sense
of the Speech clearly and distinctly.</p>

<p>While these last Preparations were making, his Excellency was taken ill
of a Fever, which occasioned some further Delay; and as his Excellency
did not recover so soon as was wished, the Sachems were told, that his
Excellency being unwilling to detain them without necessity, would, if
they desired it, direct Mr. <i>Colden</i> to speak to them in his Name, what
he designed to say. They answered, that they would be well pleased to
hear it from Mr. <i>Colden</i>'s Mouth.</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i> Colden <i>introduced the Speech as follows</i>:</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>is Excellency our Governor having been taken ill, and as yet not so
well recovered as that he can safely come abroad; has ordered me (being
the next Person to him in the Administration) to speak to you in his
Name, which I shall do in the same Words which he designed to have
spoke, had he not been prevented by Sickness.</p>

<p>"<i>Brethren</i>,</p>

<p><span class="dropcap"><small><small><sup>"</sup></small></small>I</span> am glad to see so many of our ancient Friends here, and heartily bid
you Welcome. [<i>Gave three Strings of Wampum</i>.]</p>

<p>"I have call'd you to this Place for two great Ends, in which the
Province of the <i>Massachusets-Bay</i> have sent Commissioners to concur
with me, who are here present.</p>

<p>"The <i>First</i> is, to renew the Covenant-Chain with you; and I now by this
Belt, in your Father the King of <i>Great-Britain</i>'s Name, in Behalf of
his Majesty's Subjects in <i>North-America</i>, renew and confirm the
Covenant-Chain, and all former Treaties and Engagements entered into
with you. This Chain has from the Beginning, remained so firm and
strong, that it has never once broke or slipt since it was first made;
and we, on our Parts, shall endeavour that it remain so, unshaken, as
long as the Sun and Moon shall endure. [<i>Gave a Belt</i>.]</p>

<p>"<i>Brethren</i>, Last Fall I told you, that his Majesty's Subjects in this
Country had, the Summer before, lain still, without attempting any thing
against the <i>French</i> Settlements: But that the <i>French</i> had by Surprize,
attacked and destroyed a small Place near <i>Cape-Breton</i>, belonging to
us.</p>

<p>"That they afterwards laid Siege to <i>Annapolis-Royal</i>, and were beat
off.</p>

<p>"I likewise told you, That the Governor of the <i>Massachusets-Bay</i>, in
Conjunction with <i>Connecticut</i> and <i>New-Hampshire</i>, had, in Revenge to
these Injuries, sent an Army against <i>Louisburg</i>, on the Island of
<i>Cape-Breton</i>; that the Army was joined by a Number of his Majesty's
Ships of War, under the Command of your Friend Admiral <i>Warren</i>.</p>

<p>"I told you, that the Town of <i>Louisburg</i>, which is the strongest the
<i>French</i> have in <i>America</i>, was reduced by this Force; and that the
<i>French</i> there had surrendered themselves and their Country to the
<i>English</i>.</p>

<p>"I likewise told you, how we, in this Part of the Country, had lain
still, hoping that the <i>French</i> in <i>Canada</i>, would either be quiet, or
carry on the War in a manly Manner, and after the Manner of Christians.
And to induce them thereto, a Message had been sent from this Place to
the Governor of <i>Canada</i>, to tell him, That if he should revive the
inhuman Custom of murdering private People, by sculking <i>Indians</i>, that
the several Governors of his Majesty's Colonies, together with you our
Brethren of the <i>Six Nations</i>, would join and make Reprisals on them in
the like Manner; at which time you publickly declared, that if any of
his Majesty's Subjects, in any Part of his Governments, should be killed
by any <i>Indians</i>, you would immediately join in the War against them,
and the <i>French</i>.</p>

<p>"And last Fall, when I delivered the Hatchet into your Hands, you told
me, and confirm'd it with a Belt, That you would send some of your
People (who were then ready) to <i>Canada</i>, to demand Satisfaction; and
that if Satisfaction was refused, you would use the Hatchet against
them, whenever I should order it.</p>

<p>"And you further promised, That if the Enemy should commit any further
Hostilities, you would then (upon my Commands) immediately make Use of
the Hatchet.</p>

<p>"I need not tell you, how far the <i>French</i> have been from giving
Satisfaction; on the contrary, you are well acquainted with the cruel
and barbarous Murders that have been committed, since that Time, by the
<i>French Indians</i> at <i>Saraghtoga</i>, and in the Neighbourhoods of this
Place, and on the Frontiers of <i>New-England</i>; as you have not hitherto
fulfilled your Promises, I suspect that they did not come from your
Hearts: I therefore, by this Belt, demand an immediate Performance of
your Promises, to shew that they come from the Bottom of your Hearts; as
all the Promises I make come from mine, and ever shall. [<i>Gave a Belt</i>.]</p>

<p>"<i>Brethren</i>, I now come to the <i>second</i> and principal Design of our
present Meeting, in which I hope and expect to find you hearty, and
united in your Councils and Opinions. [<i>Gave a Belt</i>.]</p>

<p>"The King your Father, having been informed of the unmanly Murders
committed on the Frontiers of <i>New England</i>, and of this Province, is
resolved to subdue the Country of <i>Canada</i>, and thereby put an End to
all the mischievous Designs of the <i>French</i> in these Parts. And for this
purpose, he has ordered his Governors of <i>Virginia, Maryland,
Pensylvania</i>, and <i>New-Jersey</i>, to join their Forces to the Forces of
this Province, to attack <i>Canada</i> by Land: They are all now upon their
March, and you will soon see them here.</p>

<p>"At the same Time the Forces of the <i>Massachusets-Bay, Connecticut,
Rhode-Island</i>, and <i>New-Hampshire</i>, are to go in Ships to <i>Cape-Breton</i>,
and there join with his Majesty's Ships of War, and a great Army of
experienc'd Soldiers from <i>Great-Britain</i>.</p>

<p>"Many Ships of War are already arrived there, and some thousand of
Soldiers; many more Ships and Soldiers are following; and I expect every
Hour to hear of their Arrival; after which the Attack upon <i>Canada</i> will
be made on all Sides, both by Sea and Land.</p>

<p>"You may perceive the King has ordered a Strength sufficient to subdue
<i>Canada</i>; but at the same Time, the King your Father expects and orders
you his Children, to join with your whole Force in this Enterprize; and
thereby gives the <i>Six Nations</i> a glorious Opportunity of establishing
their Fame and Renown over all the <i>Indian</i> Nations in <i>America</i>, in the
Conquest of your inveterate Enemies the <i>French</i>; who, however they may
dissemble and profess Friendship, can never forget the Slaughter which
your Fathers made of them; and for that purpose, caress those Nations
who have always been your inveterate Enemies, and who desire nothing so
much as to see the Name of the <i>Six Nations</i> become obliterate, and
forgot for ever. [<i>Gave a Belt</i>.]</p>

<p>"<i>Brethren</i>, The <i>French</i>, on all Occasions, shew, that they act against
your Brethren the <i>English</i>, like Men that know they dare not look them
in the Face in Day-Light; and therefore, like Thieves, steal upon poor
People, who do not expect them in the Night, and consequently are not
prepared for them: Your Brethren in their Revenge have acted like Men of
Courage; they do not attack poor Farmers at their Labour, but boldly
attempted the Reduction of <i>Louisburg</i>, the strongest Town the <i>French</i>
had in <i>America</i>, in the fortifying of which they had spent above twenty
Years: It was surrounded with strong Walls and Forts, in which they had
planted their largest Cannon in every Place, where they thought the
<i>English</i> could come near them; notwithstanding of all these Precautions
and Advantages, they were forced to submit to the <i>English</i> Valour.</p>

<p>"You must have heard from your Fathers, and I doubt not several of your
old Men still remember what the <i>French</i> did at <i>Onondaga</i>; how they
surprised your Countrymen at <i>Cadarackui</i>; how they invaded the
<i>Senekas</i>, and what Mischiefs they did to the <i>Mohawks</i>; how many of
your Countrymen suffered by the Fire at <i>Montreal</i>. Before they entered
upon these cruel and mischievous Designs, they sent Priests among you to
delude you, and lull you asleep, while they were preparing to knock you
on the Head; and I hear they are attempting to do the same now. [<i>Gave a
Belt</i>.]</p>

<p>"I need not put you in mind what Revenge your Fathers took for these
Injuries, when they put all the Island of <i>Montreal</i>, and a great Part
of <i>Canada</i>, to Fire and Sword; can you think that the <i>French</i> forget
this? No, they have the Ax privately in their Hands against you, and use
these deceitful Arts, by which only they have been able to gain
Advantage over you, that by your trusting to them, they may at some time
or other, at one Blow, remove from the Face of the Earth, the
Remembrance of a People that have so often put them to Shame and Flight.</p>

<p>"If your Fathers could now rise out of their Graves, how would their
Hearts leap with Joy to see this Day; when so glorious an Opportunity is
put into their Hands to revenge all the Injuries their Country has
received from the <i>French</i>, and be never more exposed to their Treachery
and Deceit. I make no doubt you are the true Sons of such renowned and
brave Ancestors, animated with the same Spirit for your Country's Glory,
and in Revenge of the Injuries your Fathers received, uncapable of being
deluded by the flattering Speeches of them, who always have been, and
always must be, in their Hearts, your Enemies, and who desire nothing
more, than the Destruction of your Nations.</p>

<p>"I therefore invite you, <i>Brethren</i>, by this Belt, to join with us, and
to share with us, in the Honour of the Conquest of our, and your
deceitful Enemies; and that you not only join all the Force of the <i>Six
Nations</i> with us, but likewise invite all the Nations depending on you,
to take a Share in this glorious Enterprize: And I will furnish your
fighting Men with Arms, Ammunition, Cloathing, Provisions, and every
Thing necessary for the War; and in their Absence, take Care of their
Wives and Children. [<i>Gave the War-Belt</i>.]</p>

<p>"<i>Brethren</i>, You have seen how daring and insulting on you, as well as
us, the <i>French Indians</i> have been, in cruelly murdering several of our
People, since you have come to this Place; and therefore, for the many
Reasons now laid before you, I make no doubt but your Answer will
clearly manifest your Duty to the King your Father, and your Love to
your Brethren; and by this Belt I do assure you, that our Intent is, to
live and die together." [<i>Gave a Belt of Friendship</i>.]</p>

<p>At every Stop where a Belt was given, one of the Sachems call'd out
<i>Yo-hay</i>, to which all the rest answered in a Sound which cannot be
expressed in our Letters, but seem'd to consist of two Words remarkably
distinguished in the Cadence; it seem'd to this purpose; the Sachem
calls, <i>Do your hear?</i> The Answer is, We attend and remember, or
understand; or else it is a Kind of Plaudit our Interpreters could not
explain. At the Close of the Speech, one Sachem of each Nation call'd
out severally the <i>Yo-hay</i>, to which the others of the same Nation
answer'd severally: But when the War-Belt was thrown down, they gave the
War-Shout. We expected but six of these Plaudits, according to the
Number of the <i>Six Nations</i>, but eight were distinctly delivered; by
which we understood some other Nations were united with them on this
Occasion.</p>

<p>After the Speech was delivered, the Sachems of the several Nations had
Conferences together; and some time being spent in deliberating, they
acquainted his Excellency, 'That they had agreed upon their Answer,
which they were ready to give whenever he would appoint a Time to
receive it;' and he named the next Day.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Accordingly on the 23<sup>d</sup> of <i>August</i>, His <span class="smcap">Excellency</span> being
present; the Gentlemen of the Council; the Commissioners from
<i>Boston</i>; the Commissioners for <i>Indian</i> Affairs; the
Corporation of <i>Albany</i>; and many Gentlemen, as at the Time when
his Excellency's Speech was delivered,</p></div>


<p>An <i>Onondaga</i> Sachem, who had formerly been Speaker for the <i>Six
Nations</i> on several publick Occasions, rose up and spoke: What he said
was publickly interpreted, in the Hearing of several who understood the
<i>Indian</i> Language well, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Brethren of <i>New-York</i>, and of the <i>Massachusets-Bay</i>,</p>

<p><i><span class="dropcap">W</span>e the</i> Six Nations <i>are now assembled together as one Man, and
we take in the</i> Messesagues <i>for the seventh Nation; and what is
now to be spoken by one Mouth, are the joint and sincere
Thoughts of every Heart.</i></p>

<p><i>We are pleas'd that you follow the Steps of our Fore-fathers,
in wiping off the sorrowful Tears from our Eyes, by which the
Stoppage of our Throats are opened, and the bloody Bed wash'd
clean.</i> [Gave three Strings of Wampum.]</p>

<p>Brethren, <i>The first Time we met together, we only saluted each
other by shaking of Hands; we afterwards made a Covenant Chain
of Silver, which we mutually have held fast to this Day; should
it now slip from either of our Hands, it would prove Destruction
to both Sides, since our Enemies have drawn the Sword.</i> [Gave a
Belt.]</p>

<p>Brother of <i>New-York</i>; <i>Last Year you gave us the Hatchet to be
made Use of against your Enemies, the</i> French, <i>which we
accepted and promised to make use of it if they should commit
any farther Hostilities upon the</i> English, <i>which they have now
done by destroying</i> Saraghtoga, <i>and shedding a great deal of
Blood: Hitherto we have made no use of the Hatchet; but as you
now call upon us, we are ready, and do declare from the Bottom
of our Hearts, that we will from this Day, make use of it
against the</i> French, <i>and their Children</i>, (meaning their
<i>Indians</i>.)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[N. B. The Question was asked them by his Excellency, Whether by
the Words <i>their Children</i>, they meant all the <i>Indians</i> in
Alliance with the <i>French</i>? to which they answered, <i>Yes</i>.]</p>

<p>[At the End of the foregoing Paragraph, the Speaker threw down a
War-Belt of Wampum on the Ground, it being the <i>Indian</i> Custom
to deliver War-Belts, or make Declaration of War in this Manner:
This he did with a remarkable Shew of Indignation, intending
thereby to express their Resentment against the <i>French</i> and
their Allies, and their Zeal for the <i>English</i>.] [<i>Gave a
Belt</i>.]</p></div>

<p>Brother of <i>New-York; According to your Exhortation in your
Speech to us, we are firmly united together from this Time, to
act as having one Heart; the</i> Messesagues <i>are in the same Manner
joined and united with us, likewise the Southern Nations
bordering upon us; and we hope that you, and the other Governors
on the Continent, will be in the same Manner joined and united
together.</i> [Gave a Belt.]</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[They repeated over his Excellency's Speech in Relation to the
Conquest of <i>Cape-Breton</i>; and added, <i>We hope that our Fleet
and Army will be also victorious in the present Expedition
against</i> Canada; <i>for the</i> French <i>are a mischievous People</i>.]
[Gave a Belt.]</p></div>

<p><i>As to your Suspicions of our admitting</i> French <i>Priests among
us, they are become groundless, since we have now declared War
against them: The admitting of Priests, would only tend to lull
us asleep to our Destruction; should any now dare to come, we
know no Use for them but to roast them. The Thoughts of the
Treatment we formerly received from the</i> French, <i>thro' the Means
of their Priests, and which you now seasonably have brought to
our Remembrance, makes our Blood to boil.</i></p>

<p>Brother of <i>New-York; This is the second Time you have put the
Hatchet into our Hands, which we accept, and are ready to go upon
Service. You may see that we have but a Handful of fighting Men
here at present; however, some of them from each Nation shall be
left behind us to follow your Orders.</i></p>

<p><i>When we return to our respective Castles, we shall send down a
great Number of our Warriors, and of those of the Nations in
Alliance with us, as soon as possible.</i></p>

<p><i>This we assure you of from the Truth and Sincerity of our
Hearts; and we receive, and shall preserve this large Belt</i>,
[holding it up at the same Time] <i>which you have now given us, as</i>
<i>a War-Hatchet</i>.</p>

<p>Brethren, <i>This is the Belt of Union with which we are to go Hand
in Hand to the Gate of our Enemies, and by it we declare our
Intention to conquer or die in the common Cause</i>.</p>

<p><i>There is a Nation call'd the</i> Messesagues, <i>whose Delegates are
here present: They consist of five Castles, containing eight
hundred Men, who are all determined, and do agree to join us, in
this common Cause, against our Enemies the</i> French, <i>and their</i>
Indians; <i>and we hope you, and the Commissioners from</i> Boston,
<i>will use them in such a Manner that they will go home content
and satisfied.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[Gave a Belt of Union, in which the Figures of several Persons
join'd Hand in Hand, was wrought.]</p></div></div>

<p>The Person who interpreted, returned the <i>Yo-hah</i> at the End of every
Paragraph, and having done the same at the Time they declared War, it
occasioned Laughter among them; upon which, observing his Mistake, he
began the War-Shout, in which all the <i>Indians</i> joined.</p>

<p>The <i>Messesagues</i> are a Nation of <i>Indians</i>, living near the Place
called <i>De Troit</i> by the <i>French</i>, and situate between Lake <i>Erie</i> and
the <i>Huron</i> Lake.</p>

<p>After the Speaker had finished, his Excellency told them by the
Interpreter, that the King their Father had ordered him to make them a
Present on this Occasion; and that the Government of <i>Virginia</i> had on
the same Occasion, sent them a Present. The Commissioners from <i>Boston</i>
at the same Time told them, that they had a Present from their
Government; and as they were soon to return Home, desired the <i>Six
Nations</i> to come to their Lodgings to receive it; on which the <i>Indians</i>
desired his Excellency to delay his Present to next Day, and they
immediately went to receive their Presents from the Commissioners of the
<i>Massachusets-Bay</i>.</p>

<p>The next Day, the Presents from the King being exposed on one Part, and
those from <i>Virginia</i> separately near them, it was agreed by the People
of <i>Albany</i>, who had seen many publick Presents given to the <i>Six
Nations</i> on Treaties with them, that this was the most valuable ever
given. His Excellency on giving the Presents, said;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Brethren</i>,</p>

<p><span class="dropcap"><small><small><sup>"</sup></small></small>Y</span>ou here see a Token of the Regard the King your Father has for
you; and there is a Token of the Friendship of the Government of
<i>Virginia</i>: But on this Occasion I cannot forbear taking Notice
to you, that some of your People being at <i>Canada</i>, when the
News of the Reduction of <i>Cape-Breton</i> came there, and when the
<i>French</i> expected that <i>Quebec</i> would be immediately attacked in
Consequence of it, several of them joined with the <i>French</i>, and
promised them Assistance. This occasioned some Uneasiness to
your Brethren, being contrary to the Faith of your Nations, as
well as to your Brethren's Expectations; however, you may now,
by performing the Promises you Yesterday made in the most solemn
Manner, remove all Suspicions; and for ever secure the
Friendship of your Brethren, which hitherto has from the
Beginning, remained unviolated on their Parts. The Goods now
before you, are Presents to the <i>Six Nations</i>; and, as we have
received the <i>Messesagues</i> into the Covenant between you and
us, I expect that they shall share with you. Besides these
general Presents now made to your Nations, I have prepared
proper Cloathing for your War-Captains, and the Warriors who
shall go under their Command; together with Arms, Ammunition and
Provisions, which shall be delivered to the several Parties at
the Time they shall go out on Service."</p></div>

<p>What his Excellency said having been interpreted by a <i>Mohawk</i> Sachem,
the Sachem added of his own Head, <i>You now see how you are here treated,
really like Brethren; the Governor of</i> Canada <i>does not treat his</i>
Indians <i>so; they are set on like his Dogs, and they run on without
Thought or Consideration: You see what a noble Present is made to you;
if the Governor of</i> Canada <i>should seize all the Goods in that Country,
it would not be in his Power to make such a Present.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Onondaga</i> Sachem, Speaker of the <i>Six Nations</i>, immediately
replied,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Brethren of <i>New-York, New-England</i>, and <i>Virginia</i>;</p>

<p><i><span class="dropcap">W</span>e heard, and observe well, what you now and formerly spoke to
us; and we beg no mention may hereafter be made of what passed
last Fall, since we are now heartily enter'd into the War with
you, and have promised as many fighting Men from each Castle as
can be spared; and likewise to engage as great Numbers of every
Nation in Alliance with us, as we can, to join immediately with
us in the War against the</i> French, <i>and the Nations who adhere
to them.</i></p>

<p>Brethren of <i>New-York, New-England</i>, and <i>Virginia</i>,</p>

<p><i>You must not suspect that it proceeds from any Backwardness in
us, that a greater Number of our People do not at this Instant
join with you; the Reason is, our Castles have but few fighting
Men in them, many are now Abroad, some hunting and trading with
far distant Nations, and others out fighting against our
Enemies; all these we shall recall Home as soon as possible, in
order to enter with all our Force, into the War against your and
our common Enemy.</i></p>

<p>Brother, <i>We have no more to say at this Time, but only to tell
you, we are sorry that we can so little shew our Hearts by the
Presents we now offer; our hunting has been so very poor, that
we cannot make you Presents suitable to our Inclinations.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Mohawks</i> added separately: <i>We have been employed all
Summer in your Service as Out-scouts, to gain Intelligence, or
in some Manner or other, and thereby kept from hunting: We have
no Furrs to offer you, but we here present our Persons, to serve
you wherever you shall command.</i></p></div>

<p>That Day was spent in dividing the Presents among themselves. We were
told, that these Presents were divided into eight equal Parts, of which
they gave two to the <i>Messesague</i> Deputies.</p>

<p>The next Day the War-Kettle was set over the Fire, and towards Evening
the <i>Indians</i> in his Excellency's Presence, where many Gentlemen
attended him, began the War-Dance, and continued it till late in the
Night: They were painted as when they go to War. The Dance is a slow and
solemn Motion, accompanied with a pathetick Song. The <i>Indians</i> in their
Turns perform this singly, but it is not easy to describe the
Particularities of it.</p>

<p>His Excellency call'd several of the chief Sachems who had been useful
in the Treaty, to him in private, and gave them Presents severally;
neither did he forget the <i>Messesague</i> Deputies: He had a particular
Conference with one of them in private, the other was sick of the
Small-Pox. At this Conference, this Deputy assured his Excellency of the
good Inclinations of his Nation to the <i>English</i>, and their Aversion to
the <i>French</i>; he said, 'That many of the Nations to the Westward of
them, disliked the <i>French</i>;' and as an Instance of it, he told, 'That
the <i>French</i> lately having pressed a neighbouring Nation to take up the
Hatchet against the <i>English</i>, they received it; but made Use of it
against the <i>French</i> themselves, and kill'd all the <i>French</i> then with
them, being sixty in Number, with the Loss of only one Man of their own
Nation.' His Excellency made him handsome Presents, and gave him a Belt
to carry to his Nation, with an Invitation to join in the War against
the <i>French</i>; the <i>Messesague</i> received them with a Profession of the
most sincere and hearty Friendship; and that he made no doubt of
bringing two, three, or four hundred Men of his Nation, to serve this
Fall against the <i>French</i>. He added, 'That he and several of his
Relations would immediately use their best Endeavours, with several
other Nations to the Westward of them, who were numerous, to join
against the <i>French</i>; in which, <i>he said</i>, he had great Hopes of
Success, because they were dissatisfied with the <i>French</i>.'</p>

<p>His Excellency took all possible Care of the sick <i>Messesague</i>, had him
brought into a House, and ordered him, to be attended by two Physicians;
but the poor Man had the Misfortune to die, after he had been above a
Fortnight ill. When he found himself near his End, he sent to the
Governor, to desire him as his last Request, that his Excellency would
send the first <i>French</i> Scalp that should be taken, to his Mother; and
when he was told that his Excellency had promised it, he shewed a
Contentedness and Resignation to Death. This Misfortune was increased by
the Death of the other <i>Messesague</i> Deputy likewise, who was taken ill
in his Way Home, and died. The <i>Six Nations</i> took Care of their Wives
and Children, who had come with them; and it was not doubted but that
they, and all the Presents given them, would be safely conveyed to
their own Homes.</p>

<p>Having so far given an Account of what passed with the <i>Six Nations</i>, it
may be proper next to relate the Treaty with the <i>Mehikanders</i>, or
<i>River Indians</i>, <i>viz.</i> The several Tribes of <i>Indians</i> living at
several Places on each Side of <i>Hudson</i>'s River.</p>

<p>On his Excellency's Arrival at <i>Albany</i>, having found that there had
been a Neglect in sending for the <i>Esopus</i> and <i>Minissink Indians</i>, he
sent Orders for them to be invited. The <i>Mehikanders</i> being conveened
the 21st, his Excellency directed Mr. <i>Colden</i> to speak to them in his
Name and Words; which Mr. <i>Colden</i> did; the other Gentlemen of the
Council, the Commissioners from <i>Boston</i>, the Commissioners for <i>Indian</i>
Affairs, and several other Gentlemen being present, in the Words
following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Children</i>,</p>

<p><span class="dropcap"><small><small><sup>"</sup></small></small>I</span> am glad to meet you at this Time, as are likewise the
Commissioners from the <i>Massachusets-Bay</i>, who are now come
hither to concur with me upon the present Occasion; and I take
this Opportunity to renew the ancient Covenant Chain with you,
in Behalf of this and all his Majesty's Governments in
<i>America</i>, which you know has always been kept bright and clean,
without any of the least Stain or Rust, and which by this Belt I
strengthen. [<i>Gave a Belt</i>.]</p>

<p>"<i>Children</i>, My meeting you here, besides renewing the Covenant
Chain, is with Intention that you should join your Force with
ours, by taking up the Hatchet against our and your common
Enemies the <i>French</i>, and their <i>Indians</i>; who have in a very
unmanly Manner, by sculking Parties, murdered in cold Blood,
many of your Brethren in this and the Province of the
<i>Massachusets-Bay</i>.</p>

<p>"This Behaviour lays us under a Necessity of making Reprisals
on them in like Manner, in which I make no doubt of your
Assistance; and we are resolved to take a thorough Revenge of
our and your perpetual Enemies, by reducing the Country of
<i>Canada</i>, that it may not be in the Power of these perfidious,
deceitful, and cruel People, to do you or us any Injury for the
future: For which Purpose all the neighbouring Colonies,
together with many Ships of War and Soldiers from
<i>Great-Britain</i>, are resolved to unite their Force, and to
attack <i>Canada</i> in all Parts, both by Sea and Land; and I make
no doubt, you will on this Occasion shew yourselves dutiful
Children, in joining heartily with us and the <i>Six Nations</i>, in
this glorious Enterprize; by which you will not only gain Honour
and Renown, but also Safety and Prosperity to yourselves, your
Wives, and Children for ever afterwards: And for which End I
will furnish your fighting Men with Arms, Ammunition, Cloathing,
Provisions, and every Thing necessary for the War." [<i>Gave a
War-Belt</i>.]</p></div>

<p>On the 26th they gave their Answer, which was interpreted in the
following Words; (the same Persons being present, that were when the
Governor's Speech was delivered to them.)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Father,</p>

<p><i><span class="dropcap">W</span>e are glad to see you; and we are come to renew the Covenant
Chain, and make it fast and bright as ever, and free from Rust,
and as a Token thereof we give you this Belt.</i> [Gave a Belt.]</p>

<p>Father, <i>You have told us what Mischief the</i> French <i>have done,
and what Murders upon the Christians they have committed;
therefore we declare from our Hearts, and not from our Lips
only, that as you have ordered us to shed the Enemies' Blood in
Return for what they have done, we are resolved to live and die
with you in the common Cause.</i></p>

<p><i>When you Christians are at War, you make Peace with one
another, but it is not so with us, therefore we depend upon you
to take Care of us; in Confidence of which, we now take up the
Hatchet, and will make Use of it against the</i> French, <i>and
their</i> Indians. [Gave a Belt with a Hatchet.]</p></div>

<p>After their Answer they began the War-Dance, and his Excellency ordered
a considerable Present in Goods to be publickly given them. None of
these are suspected to be under <i>French</i> Influence.</p>

<p>As there was no Advice of the Arrival of the Fleet, and no Plan of
Operations agreed on in Case the Fleet did not arrive, the supporting of
about seven hundred <i>Indians</i> was a great Expence to his Excellency, for
which he had no Allowance from the Province of <i>New-York</i>, or for any
other Charge attending this Treaty: And as many of the <i>Indians</i>, (above
twenty) had got the Small-pox, it being impracticable to prevent their
going into Town, or conversing with the Town's People, and the <i>Indians</i>
becoming uneasy by Reason of the Sickness of many, and Death of some;
his Excellency thought it most prudent to dismiss them as soon as
possible from this Place, and to give Orders to Mr. <i>Johnson</i>, to send
out several Parties from <i>Schenectade</i>, or his own Settlement near the
lower <i>Mohawk</i> Castle, to harrass the <i>French</i> Settlements in <i>Canada</i>;
and for that Purpose delivered to him Cloathing, Arms and Ammunition, to
be given to the fighting Men, as his Excellency had promised them
whenever they entered on Service, and impowered him to furnish them with
Provisions, and whatever Necessaries they should want.</p>

<p>Before they went, his Excellency sent to them, to desire them to leave
their Sick, with a Promise to take all Care possible of them, and that
he would order Physicians to attend them. They were very sensible of
this Kindness, and acknowledged it; but not above two or three could be
prevailed to stay, who were so ill that they could not be removed: All
possible Care was taken of the other Sick, in the Waggons which carried
them to <i>Schenectade</i>.</p>

<p>On the 26th of <i>September</i>, the Captains <i>Staats</i> and <i>Vromen</i>, brought
the <i>Indians</i> living on the Branches of the <i>Susquehannah</i> River; they
came in the <i>Indian</i> Order, marching in a single Line one after the
other, and as they passed the Fort, saluted by a running Fire along the
Line; which Salute the Governor ordered to be returned, by a Discharge
of some Cannon from the Fort.</p>

<p>On <i>Monday</i> the 8th of the same Month his Excellency spoke to them,
telling them the Substance of what he had ordered to be said to the <i>Six
Nations</i>, and their Answer; and as this has been set forth at Length
before, it is needless to repeat what was then said. The Reason of his
Excellency's speaking to them in this Manner was, because these Nations
living on the <i>Susquehannah</i> River and its Branches, are known to be
Dependents on the <i>Six Nations</i>.</p>

<p>The next Day they gave their Answer; the Gentlemen of the Council, the
Commissioners for <i>Indian</i> Affairs, the Corporation of <i>Albany</i>, the
Officers of the four Independent Companies, and several Officers of the
new Levies, and other Gentlemen being present, as they were when his
Excellency spoke to the <i>Indians</i>: Their Answer was publickly
interpreted as follows;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Brother of <i>New-York</i>,</p>

<p><i><span class="dropcap">W</span>e live at</i> Ohguago; <i>what News you send to the</i> Six Nations
<i>is not truly reported to us, nor what the Governor of</i> Canada
<i>sends to them; we have not been properly taken Notice of, nor
timely acquainted with your Design to treat with the</i> Six
Nations, <i>till near the Time that your Interview with them was
over; otherwise we should have readily come along with them, to
hear what our Brother had to propose to us; and if we had
received earlier Notice, a much larger Number of our fighting
Men would have come along with us: Our Settlements are
scattering, and some of them at a great Distance from others,
and many of our Men are from Home a hunting; we have, however,
sent the Belt of Invitation forward to those who live at a
greater Distance, that they may be able at the Time appointed,
to come and join us in the War, as by your Belt we were
desired.</i></p>

<p>Brother, <i>You Yesterday informed us of what you had said to the</i>
Six Nations, <i>and their Answer; we are grieved that the</i> Six
Nations <i>have not already made use of the Hatchet, but have
hitherto kept it by them, and have not sent out their young Men
to revenge the Murders which have been committed by the Enemy.</i></p>

<p><i>We are resolved to make use of the Hatchet against the</i> French,
<i>to revenge the Injuries done to you and your People, our
Brethren.</i></p>

<p><i>We have received at Times very different Kind of News from the</i>
Six Nations, <i>sometimes it seemed as if the</i> French <i>would be
Masters; but it cannot be so, they are a deceitful People, and
cannot be trusted; they make fair Promises, and have no
Intention to perform them; they flatter themselves with Hopes to
be Masters, but they shall be disappointed; for we shall keep
the Hatchet firmly in our Hands, and are resolved to make Use of
it.</i></p>

<p><i>We know several Roads that lead to</i> Canada, <i>we want to see the
Hatchet, that we may take it up.</i></p></div>

<p>Upon which his Excellency threw down a Hanger, which the Speaker took up
and began the War-Dance, and several others danced the same after him.</p>

<p>After which they desired his Excellency to take Care of them, as he had
promised.</p>

<p>His Excellency returned them Thanks for their so readily taking up the
Hatchet; he said, that he would presently set the War-Kettle over the
Fire, and provide them with every Thing necessary for the War. His
Excellency gave them a handsome Present in publick for their Nations in
general, and private Presents to their principal Sachems; one of which
promised, that after his return Home, he would go round all the <i>Indian</i>
Settlements, to invite them into the War against the <i>French</i>, and their
<i>Indians</i>; and that he did not doubt to be able to bring six hundred Men
from the <i>Indian</i> Settlements on the <i>Susquehannah</i> River and its
Branches, to march at any Time, and to any Place, his Excellency should
appoint, in order to join the Forces intended against <i>Canada</i>; in the
mean Time they would cause a Party of their Men to go out with his Men
to scour the Woods, and clear them of the <i>French</i> sculking <i>Indians</i>.</p>

<p>About this Time, a Serjeant of Capt. <i>Livingston</i>'s Company was
surprized and killed by a sculking Party of <i>French Indians</i>: In a few
Minutes after the Account of this came to his Excellency, who happened
to be dining at that Time in Capt. <i>Wrexall's</i> Tent, fourteen of the
<i>Susquehannah Indians</i> were observed running past the Tent, in order to
cross the River, and meet the <i>French Indians</i>; which his Excellency
observing, and being apprehensive that they might meet with some of the
Parties of the new Levies that were gone out for the same Purpose, and
that they might be in Danger of being attacked through Mistake; he ask'd
if any of the Guard which then attended, would voluntarily go along with
the <i>Indians</i>? Two Men offered themselves, who went with one who
understood the <i>Indian</i> Language, in order to prevent Mistakes. Happy it
was that this Precaution was taken; for Capt. <i>Fanning</i> with a great
Part of his Company, having gone out with the same Intention of
intercepting the <i>French Indians</i>, he discovered this Party of our
<i>Indians</i>, and taking them to be <i>French Indians</i>, he kept his Men under
the Cover of some Bushes, with their Arms ready to fire, expecting the
nearer Approach of the <i>Indians</i>; when one of the Christians who were
with them, observing Capt. <i>Fanning</i>'s Men, called out, and came up to
Capt. <i>Fanning</i> when his Men were ready to fire. None of the Parties
that went out were able to discover any of the Enemy.</p>

<p>His Excellency afterwards sent out sixteen of these <i>Indians</i>, and
cloathed them for that Purpose, together with about sixty Men detached
from the Companies levied in the County of <i>Albany</i>, in order to scour
the Woods, and to advance as far as the Lakes to gain Intelligence, by
taking Prisoners or otherwise. While this Party was out, some of the
<i>Indians</i> fell sick, and the others being apprehensive of the same
Misfortune, they return'd, after having been but a few Days in the
Woods. His Excellency then perceiving the Uneasiness the <i>Indians</i> were
under from the Apprehensions of Sickness, found it necessary to dismiss
them all, on their Promise to return, whenever his Excellency should
order, with all the Force they shall be able to collect; and which, they
said, as before observed, might amount to six hundred Men. The Number of
<i>Indians</i> that came at this Time from the <i>Susquehannah</i> River,
consisted only of about sixty fighting Men, besides old Men, Women, and
Children: More had come near to <i>Albany</i>, but having there heard of the
Small-pox and Sickness that was at <i>Albany</i>, and that many of the <i>Six
Nations</i> had catched the Infection, and several of them were dead, they
returned back.</p>

<p>After the <i>Six Nations</i> left <i>Albany</i>, many of them were taken sick on
their Way Home, before they reached the <i>Mohawk</i> Castles, and a
considerable Number of the briskest young Men of the <i>Mohawks</i> died.
This retarded the Execution of the Order given to Mr. <i>Johnson</i>, to
send out Parties to harrass the <i>French</i> Settlements in <i>Canada</i>, though
he used all the Means in his Power to effect it. While he was pressing
them to this Purpose, one of the Sachems who had promised to head a
Party from the <i>Canajohary</i> Castle, said, <i>You seem to think that we are
Brutes, that we have no Sense of the Loss of our dearest Relations, and
some of them the bravest Men we had in our Nation: You must allow us
Time to bewail our Misfortune</i>.</p>

<p>About ten Days before his Excellency left <i>Albany</i>, a Party of upwards
of seventy Men, consisting of some of each Nation, went against
<i>Canada</i>: Some Christians were of the Party to assist and direct, and to
be Witnesses of the behaviour of the <i>Indians</i>. They were to avoid all
the Lakes, and the usual Roads and Passes to <i>Canada</i>, and were to go
thro' the Woods over Mountains, that are seldom passed, to prevent the
Enemies discovering them: But after these had been out, Capt. <i>Butler</i>'s
Son, to whom the chief Direction of this Party was committed, was taken
ill of the Small-pox, and five of the <i>Indians</i> were obliged to return
to carry him Home. Another small Party was sent out to take Prisoners,
and gain Intelligence at <i>Crown-Point</i>. At the writing of this, it is
not known what Success they have had.</p>

<p>When the <i>Six Nations</i> had come as far as the lower <i>Mohawk</i> Castle, in
their return Home, they were met by about six Men of their own Nations,
who delivered a Message from <i>Canada</i>, which had been brought by the
<i>Indian</i> who was taken by the <i>French</i> at <i>Crown Point</i>, and carried to
<i>Canada</i>. The Message was interpreted in the following Words: "The
Governor of <i>Canada</i> had called the <i>Cahnuaga Indians</i> to him, and then
complained to them, that some of the <i>Six Nations</i>, his Children, had
killed some of his People: You all know, <i>he said</i>, that I am not hasty
or passionate, but will rather bear a great deal than shew Resentment,
wherefore I am resolved to pass this over; but in the mean Time I must
desire you to go among the <i>Six Nations</i>, to find out the Reason of this
Proceeding, and to tell them, that is any Thing like it happen again, I
will make them smart: You may nevertheless assure my Children<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of the
<i>Six Nations</i>, that I love and esteem them equally with the <i>Cahnuagas</i>,
or <i>Shawendadies</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, being of the same Blood. And to convince them of
my Love, I now send back to them one of their People that was taken at
<i>Crown Point</i>, without eating his Flesh. And now <i>Cahnuagas</i>, my
Children, I would not have you spill any more Blood from <i>Albany</i>
upwards, for I begin to pity their Weakness; but turn your Arms towards
<i>New-England</i>, against your most inveterate Enemies, there is the Place
for you to gain Honour now."</p>

<p>The <i>Cahnuagas</i> gave the following Answer to the Governor of <i>Canada</i>:
Father, <i>You are in the wrong, to desire us to go among the</i> Six Nations
<i>for Intelligence, or with Menaces; for such will only stir them up, and
bring them and all their Allies (who are very numerous) upon you, to
destroy you at once. We know they are not to be bullied by your Words or
ours, wherefore,</i> Father, <i>we must leave you to go through this Work by
yourself.</i></p>

<p>After having as above, related what had passed between them and the
Governor of <i>Canada</i>, they sent the following Message from themselves.</p>

<p><i>Brethren of the Six Nations</i>, "We hear the Governor of <i>New-York</i> has
invited you to meet him; we intreat you not to mind any Thing he shall
say, in order to set you against us; for if you do, you, as well as we,
must all die. Wherefore, <i>Brethren</i>, we conjure you by all the Ties of
Friendship subsisting between us, to inform us of any Design that is
plotting against us; and that when any such Thing shall be discovered,
you will send an Express to <i>Cadarackui</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, where our Fire always
burns.</p>

<p>"<i>Brethren</i>, We shall be glad to see you next Spring at <i>Cahnuaga</i>, to
hold a Council together, where you shall be as safe and welcome as ever.</p>

<p>"<i>Brethren</i>, The Governor our Father, being informed, that your Governor
is raising Men to come against <i>Canada</i>, desires us to tell you, that he
has <i>one thousand eight hundred</i> Men at <i>Crown Point</i>, ready to give
them Battle; in which Number, the Men of eight Castles of the <i>Utawawas</i>
are included.</p>

<p>"<i>Brethren</i>, Be not angry at our destroying <i>Saraghtoga</i> last Fall; Col.
<i>Schuyler</i> dar'd us to it, by saying he wished to see a <i>French</i> Army
there: We gratified him in his Wish."</p>

<p>A <i>Cahnuaga Indian</i> was sent along with the Prisoner that was restored;
but when he came near the Settlements of the <i>Six Nations</i>, his Heart
fail'd him, and he sent the Prisoner forward by himself with the
Message.</p>

<p>The Readiness with which the <i>Six Nations</i> communicated this Message,
and the flight they in all Appearance put upon it, is some Proof of
their Sincerity in the Promises they made to his Excellency; neither
from any Thing which has happened can it be shewn, that they were not
sincere. On the contrary, it appears by Mr. <i>Johnson</i>'s Letter to his
Excellency of the 21st of <i>October</i>, that several Parties are now out
against the <i>French</i>; and that Mr. <i>Johnson</i> having received Orders
from Col. <i>Roberts</i>, to send as many <i>Indians</i> as possible to join the
Army, all the <i>Mohawks</i>, even their oldest Men, were fitted out and
ready; and having sent to the upper Castles at the same Time, they
appeared so hearty, that there would not have remained above three old
Men in any of the next Castles: And that Col. <i>Roberts</i> afterwards
contradicting these Orders, they had appeared very uneasy on their being
stopt. It was not expected that they would enter into the War without
us, or by themselves, neither are they a People of so little Thought, as
to give any Reason to expect it from them.</p>

<p>When the Companies raised in <i>Pensylvania</i> arrived at <i>Albany</i>, his
Excellency was informed by their Captains, that Mr. <i>Thomas</i> Governor of
that Province, had sent <i>Conrad Weiser</i> their publick Interpreter, among
the <i>Susquehannah Indians</i>; and that they expected his Arrival at this
Place in a little Time, with at least three hundred <i>Indians</i>. The
Treaties with the <i>Indians</i>, which Mr. <i>Thomas</i> has published, gave
great Hopes of the Success that Interpreter would have; and thereby
increased the Disappointment, when Mr. <i>Weiser</i> arrived a few Days
before his Excellency left <i>Albany</i>, and did not bring one <i>Indian</i> with
him.</p>

<p>His Excellency Governor <i>Clinton</i>, had perhaps more Difficulties to
struggle with on this Occasion, than any Governor of <i>New-York</i> had at
any Time: The <i>Six Nations</i> had on several Occasions given Grounds of
Mistrust; the Governor of <i>Canada</i> was attempting all the Means in his
Power to divert their Affections from us; the People of the County of
<i>Albany</i> had for some Time past, entertained a Dissatisfaction in the
Conduct of the Commissioners for <i>Indian</i> Affairs; the Commissioners
themselves were divided in their Sentiments, and several of them refused
to attend their Meetings; and they confessed to his Excellency, that
they had lost all Influence on the <i>Indians</i>; Mr. <i>Gooch</i> having
declined the Command of the Forces at <i>Albany</i>, his Excellency was
forced likewise to undertake a new and great Care, which he in no Manner
expected when he left the City of <i>New York</i>, and which from many
Incidents, was attended with many Difficulties. If these Things be duly
considered, and the Dangers his Person was in from the Infection of two
different Diseases, which at that Time raged in the City of <i>Albany</i>, of
which great Numbers died during his Residence there of near three
Months; none can doubt of his hearty Zeal for the Success of an Affair,
in which the Safety and Prosperity of all the Colonies in North
<i>America</i>, were immediately concerned.</p>

<p>But as every one may not be sufficiently apprized of what Consequence
the <i>Six Nations</i> being hearty, is to the Interest of <i>Great-Britain</i>,
it may be proper to observe, That though a Number of <i>Indians</i> to march
with the Army, which was intended to attack <i>Canada</i>, would be of great
Use in discovering and defeating the Ambushes of the Enemy's <i>Indians</i>,
while they were every Day to be guarded against by the Forces which were
to march by Land, and would by their Incursions into the Enemy's
Country, terribly harass them, and keep them from joining their Forces
into any great Body to oppose the Design; these are not the most
considerable Advantages might be gained from the Affection of the <i>Six
Nations</i> at this Time, or any Time of War; for if the inland Extent of
the Colonies from <i>Nova Scotia</i> to <i>Georgia</i> be considered, and at the
same Time the numerous <i>Indian</i> Nations on the Continent of <i>America</i>,
who may by the Artifices of the <i>French</i> be induced to make Incursions
every where; and the cruel Methods by which the <i>Indians</i> make
Incursions in small Parties, from the vast Forest which every where
covers the Continent, and which in many Places is impenetrable; it must
evidently appear, that though the <i>English</i> Colonies be of much superior
Force in Numbers of Men, yet their Number would not be sufficient to
protect their Frontiers from the Incursions of the <i>Indians</i> in every
Place: And, that while their Forces must in this Case be divided and
scattered all over their Frontiers, it may be in the Power of the
<i>French</i> in <i>Canada</i>, to invade with Success any Part of the <i>English</i>
Colonies. On the other Hand, if a proper Attempt were to be made by the
Northern Colonies alone, without the Assistance of their Mother Country,
but with the Assistance of the <i>Indians</i>, it would in all Appearance be
sufficient to reduce <i>Canada</i>; for if the <i>Indian</i> Nations can be
persuaded to join heartily, (as from what is above related it seems
probable they may) it will be impossible for the Inhabitants of <i>Canada</i>
to defend themselves from the Incursions of these numerous <i>Indian</i>
Nations, and from a Body of regular Troops at the same Time. As the
<i>French</i> are very sensible of these Advantages to be gain'd from the
Friendship of the <i>Indian</i> Nations, they neglect no Means in their Power
to procure them: And it is to be hoped, that the Northern Colonies will
be no less assiduous in a Matter on which their Well-being at least
depends.</p>

<p>Some People wish that the <i>Indians</i> may remain neuter, and think it
adviseable to pursue Measures for that Purpose, by which many horrid
Barbarities would be prevented. No doubt this is to be wished; but can
the <i>English</i> Colonies by any Means be assured, that the <i>French</i> will
be sincere in preserving such a Neutrality? And if they be not sincere,
we shall more certainly expose ourselves to all these Calamities, than
we are now by <i>Indians</i> being engaged on both Sides. The <i>Six Nations</i>
are by their natural Inclinations, disposed to War-like Enterprizes:
They never have been at Peace with all their Neighbours, since they were
known to Christians. The Reputation they have gained among all the
<i>Indian</i> Nations in North <i>America</i>, gives them an Influence in the
Councils of every Nation. It may then be easy for the <i>French</i> to turn
this Disposition to War in the <i>Six Nations</i>, against us, and by their
Influence draw all the <i>Indian</i> Nations in North <i>America</i> upon us. The
Genius of the <i>Six Nations</i> will not suffer them to remain inactive,
while their Neighbours are at War.</p>

<p>In the last Place, it may not be improper to observe at this Time, that
though the Colonies to the Southward (and the Inhabitants of the Parts
of the Northern Colonies, which are less exposed to the Incursions of
<i>Indians</i>) think themselves little concerned in Interest, or in the
Consequences of the present War; yet if they would consider that the
Northern Colonies are really their Frontiers, and that they defend the
others from all the Calamities of a most barbarous War; the Southern
Colonies must think that any Contribution of Men and Money, which is
expected from them, is an easy Purchase of the Freedom from such
Calamities, to which their Brethren are subjected; and that while they
can follow their Occupations at Ease, they are much better enabled to
support the Expence of a War than the Northern Colonies are, where the
Inhabitants are every Day in Danger of their Lives from a cruel Enemy,
while at their daily and innocent Labours. If the Southern Colonies
neglect to keep the War at a Distance from them, they may at an improper
Time, become sensible of the Evils their Brethren suffer, and of their
own Folly at the same Time.</p>

<br />
<p style="margin-left: 50%;"><i>New-York, Dec.</i> 2, 1746.</p>

<p>The Party of seventy <i>Indians</i> and Whites mentioned in this Treaty, did
not go out together as was at first intended, Sickness and other
Incidents made it necessary to alter the Measures at first proposed. One
Party of thirty <i>Indians</i> and ten Whites went by themselves. These fell
upon a <i>French</i> Settlement on the North-side of <i>St. Lawrence</i> River,
about 10 Leagues above <i>Montreal</i>, and brought away eight <i>French</i>
Prisoners, one of them a Captain of Militia, and four Scalps. Another
Party of nine <i>Indians</i> went to the <i>Cahnuagas</i>, under Pretence of
continuing the Neutrality with them, they were introduced to the
Governor of <i>Montreal</i> under the same Pretence, who made them Presents:
Their Design was to gain what Intelligence they could, and after they
had done this, they acted their Part so well, that they received several
Letters, one from the Governor of <i>Montreal</i>, and others from
considerable Persons to the Commandant of Fort <i>St. Frederic</i> at <i>Crown

<h4>The <span class="gesperrt">FRAME</span> of the Government of the Province of <i>Pensilvania</i> in
<i>America</i>: Together with certain <span class="gesperrt">LAWS</span> agreed upon in <i>England</i>.
By the Governor and divers Freemen of the aforesaid Province. To
be further explained and continued there, by the first
Provincial Council that shall he held, if they see meet.</h4>

<h4>The <span class="gesperrt">PREFACE</span>.</h4>

<p><i><span class="gesperrt"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN</span> the great and wise <span class="gesperrt">GOD</span> had made the World, of all his Creatures it
pleased him to chuse Man his Deputy to rule it; and to fit him for so
great a Charge and Trust, he did not only qualify him with Skill and
Power, but with Integrity to use them justly. This native Goodness was
equally his Honour and his Happiness; and whilst he stood here, all went
well; there was no need of coercive or compulsive Means; the Precept of
divine Love and Truth in his Bosom was the Guide and Keeper of his
Innocency. But Lust prevailing against Duty, made a lamentable Breach
upon it; and the Law, that had before no Power over him, took place upon
him and his disobedient Posterity, that such as would not live
conformable to the holy Law within, should fall under the Reproof and
Correction of the just Law without, in a judicial Administration.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="gesperrt">THIS</span> the Apostle teaches in divers of his Epistles:</i> The Law (<i>says
he</i>) was added because of Transgression: <i>In another Place</i>, Knowing
that the Law was not made for the righteous Man; but for the disobedient
and ungodly, for Sinners, for unholy and prophane, for Murderers, for
Whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with Mankind, and for
Men-stealers, for Liars, for perjured Persons, &amp;c. <i>But this is not all,
he opens and carries the Matter of Government a little further:</i> Let
every Soul be subject to the higher Powers; for there is no Power but of
<span class="gesperrt">GOD</span>. The Powers that be are ordained of <span class="gesperrt">GOD</span>: Whosoever therefore
resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of <span class="gesperrt">GOD</span>. For Rulers are not
a Terror to good Works, but to evil: Wilt thou then not be afraid of the
Power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have Praise of the
same.&mdash;He is the Minister of <span class="gesperrt">GOD</span> to thee for good.&mdash;Wherefore ye must
needs be subject, not only for Wrath, but for Conscience sake.</p>

<p><i><span class="gesperrt">This</span> settles the divine Right of Government beyond Exception, and that
for two Ends: First to terrify evil Doers; Secondly to cherish those
that do well; which gives Government a Life beyond Corruption, and makes
it as durable in the Word, as good Men shall be. So that Government
seems to me a Part of Religion itself, a Thing sacred in its Institution
and End. For if it does not directly remove the Cause, it crushes the
Effects of Evil, and is as such (though a lower yet) an Emanation of the
same divine Power, that is both Author and Object of pure Religion; the
Difference lying here, that the one is more free and mental, the other
more corporal and compulsive in its Operations: But that is only to evil
Doers; Government itself being otherwise as capable of Kindness,
Goodness, and Charity, as a more private Society. They weakly err, that
think there is no other Use of Government than Correction, which is the
coarsest Part of it: Daily Experience tells us, that the Care and
Regulation of many other Affairs, more soft and daily necessary, make up
much the greatest Part of Government; and which must have followed the
Peopling of the World, had</i> Adam <i>never fell, and will continue among
Men on Earth under the highest Attainments they may arrive at, by the
coming of the blessed</i> Second Adam, <i>the <span class="gesperrt">LORD</span> from Heaven. Thus much of
Government in general, as to its Rise and End.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="gesperrt">FOR</span> particular</i> Frames <i>and</i> Models, <i>it will become me to say little;
and comparatively I will say nothing. My Reasons are:</i> First, <i>That the
Age is too nice and difficult for it; there being nothing the Wits of
Men are more busy and divided upon. 'Tis true, they seem to agree in
the End,</i> to wit, <i>Happiness; but in the Means they differ, as to
divine, so to this human Felicity; and the Cause is much the same, not
always Want of Light and Knowledge, but Want of Using them rightly. Men
side with their Passions against their Reason, and their sinister
Interests have so strong a Biass upon their Minds, that they lean to
them against the good of the things they know.</i></p>

<p>Secondly, <i>I do not find a Model in the World, that Time, Place, and
some singular Emergencies have not necessarily altered; nor is it easy
to frame a civil Government, that shall serve all Places alike.</i></p>

<p>Thirdly, <i>I know what is said by the several Admirers of</i> Monarchy,
Aristocracy, <i>and</i> Democracy, <i>which are the Rule of one, a few, and
many, and are the three common Ideas of Government, when Men discourse
on that Subject. But I chuse to solve the Controversy with this small
Distinction, and it belongs to all three:</i> Any Government is free to the
People under it (<i>whatever be the Frame</i>) where the Laws rule, and the
People are a Party to those Laws; <i>and more than this is Tyranny,
Oligarchy, or Confusion</i>.</p>

<p><i>BUT</i> Lastly, <i>when all is said, there is hardly one Frame of Government
in the World so ill designed by its first Founders, that in good Hands
would not do well enough; and Story tells us, the best in ill ones can
do nothing that is great or good; Witness the</i> Jewish <i>and</i> Roman
<i>States. Governments, like Clocks, go from the Motion Men give them; and
as Governments are made and moved by Men, so by them they are ruined
too. Wherefore Governments rather depend upon Men, than Men upon
Governments. Let Men be good, and the Government can't be bad; if it be
ill, they will cure it. But if Men be bad, let the Government be never
so good, they will endeavour to warp and spoil it to their Turn.</i></p>

<p><i>I know some say, Let us have good Laws, and no matter for the Men that
execute them: But let them consider, That though good Laws do well, good
Men do better: For good Laws may want good Men, and be abolished or
evaded by ill Men; but good Men will never want good Laws, nor suffer
ill ones. 'Tis true, good Laws have some awe upon ill Ministers, but
that is where they have no Power to escape or abolish them, and the
People are generally wise and good: But a loose and depraved People
(which is to the Question) love Laws and an Administration like
themselves. That therefore which makes a good Constitution, must keep
it,</i> viz. <i>Men of Wisdom and Virtue, Qualities, that because they
descend not with worldly Inheritances, must be carefully propagated by a
virtuous Education of Youth; for which After-Ages will owe more to the
Care and Prudence of Founders and the successive Magistracy, than to
their Parents for their private Patrimonies.</i></p>

<p><i>THESE Considerations of the Weight of Government, and the nice and
various Opinions about it, made it uneasy to me to think of publishing
the ensuing Frame and conditional Laws, foreseeing, both the Censures
they will meet with from Men of differing Humours and Engagements, and
the Occasion they may give of Discourse beyond my Design.</i></p>

<p><i>BUT next to the Power of Necessity, (which is a Solicitor that will
take no Denial) this induced me to a Compliance, that we have (with
Reverence to <span class="gesperrt">GOD</span> and good Conscience to Men) to the best of our Skill,
contrived and composed the</i> <span class="gesperrt">FRAME</span> and <span class="gesperrt">LAWS</span> of this Government, <i>to the
great End of all Government</i>, viz. To support Power in Reverence with
the People, and to secure the People from the Abuse of Power; <i>that they
may be free by their just Obedience, and the Magistrates honourable for
their just Administration: For Liberty without Obedience is Confusion,
and Obedience without Liberty is Slavery. To carry this Evenness is
partly owing to the Constitution, and partly to the Magistracy: Where
either of these fail, Government will be subject to Convulsions; but
where both are wanting, it must be totally subverted: Then where both
meet, the Government is like to endure. Which I humbly pray, and hope</i>
<span class="gesperrt">GOD</span> <i>will please to make the Lot of this of</i> Pensilvania. <i>Amen.</i></p>

fit to nominate and appoint such Persons for Judges, Treasurers, Masters

fitly qualified for those Employments; to whom I shall make and grant
Commissions for the said Officers, respectively, to hold to them to whom
the same shall be granted, for so long Time as every such Person shall

pleased to give and grant unto them a Charter of Liberties and
Privileges, dated the <i>twenty-fifth</i> Day of the <i>second</i> Month, <i>One
Thousand Six Hundred and Eighty-two</i>: By which Charter it is said, the
Government shall consist of the Governor and Freemen of the said

make up a general Assembly, according to Charter. And that the said
respective Sheriffs by their Returns, and the Freemen by their Petitions

of the People, their Inability in Estate, and Unskilfulness in Matters
of Government, will not permit them to serve in so large a Council and
Assembly, as by the Charter is expressed; and therefore do desire, that
the Members now chosen to be their Deputies and Representatives, may

<p><i><span class="gesperrt">WILLIAM PENN</span></i>, Proprietary and Governor of the Province of
<i>Pensylvania</i>, and Territories thereunto belonging. To all to whom these
Presents shall come, sendeth Greeting. <span class="gesperrt">WHEREAS</span> King <i><span class="gesperrt">CHARLES</span> the
Second</i>, by his Letters Patents, under the Great Seal of <i>England</i>,
bearing Date the <i>fourth</i> Day of <i>March</i>, in the Year <i>one Thousand six
Hundred and Eighty</i>, was graciously pleased to give and grant unto me,
and my Heirs and Assigns for ever, this Province of <i>Pensylvania</i>, with
divers great Powers and Jurisdictions for the well Government thereof.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">AND WHEREAS</span> the King's dearest Brother, <i><span class="gesperrt">JAMES</span> Duke of <span class="gesperrt">YORK</span> and <span class="gesperrt">ALBANY</span></i>,
&amp;c. by his Deeds of Feoffment, under his Hand and Seal duly perfected,
bearing Date the <i>twenty-fourth</i> Day of <i>August, one Thousand six
Hundred Eighty and Two</i>, did grant unto me, my Heirs and Assigns, all
that Tract of Land, now called the Territories of <i>Pensylvania</i>,
together with Powers and Jurisdictions for the good Government thereof.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">AND WHEREAS</span> for the Encouragement of all the Freemen and Planters, that
might be concerned in the said Province and Territories, and for the
good Government thereof, I the said <span class="smcap">William Penn</span>, in the Year <i>one
Thousand six Hundred Eighty and Three</i>, for me, my Heirs and Assigns,
did grant and confirm unto all the Freemen, Planters and Adventurers
therein, divers Liberties, Franchises and Properties, as by the said
Grant, entituled, <i>The <span class="gesperrt">FRAME</span> of the Government of the Province of</i>
Pensylvania, <i>and Territories thereunto belonging</i>, in <i>America</i>, may
appear; which Charter or Frame being found in some Parts of it, not so
suitable to the present Circumstances of the Inhabitants, was in the
<i>third</i> Month, in the Year <i>one Thousand seven Hundred</i>, delivered up to
me, by <i>six</i> Parts of <i>seven</i> of the Freemen of this Province and
Territories, in general Assembly met, Provision being made in the said
Charter, for that End and Purpose.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">AND WHEREAS</span> I was then pleased to promise, That I would restore the said
Charter to them again, with necessary Alterations, or in Lieu thereof,
give them another, better adapted to answer the present Circumstances
and Conditions of the said Inhabitants; which they have now, by their
Representatives in general Assembly, met at <i>Philadelphia</i>, requested me
to grant.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">KNOW YE THEREFORE</span>, That for the further Well-being and good Government
of the said Province, and Territories; and in Pursuance of the Rights
and Powers before-mentioned, I the said <i>William Penn</i> do declare, grant
and confirm, unto all the Freemen, Planters and Adventurers, and other
Inhabitants in this Province and Territories, these following Liberties,
Franchises and Privileges, so far as in me lieth, to be held, enjoyed
and kept, by the Freemen, Planters and Adventurers, and other
Inhabitants of and in the said Province and Territories thereunto
annexed, for ever.</p>


<h4><span class="gesperrt">FIRST</span>.</h4>

<p><span class="gesperrt">BECAUSE</span> no People can be truly happy, though under the greatest
Enjoyment of civil Liberties, if abridged of the Freedom of their
Consciences, as to their religious Profession and Worship: And Almighty
God being the only Lord of Conscience, Father of Lights and Spirits, and
the Author as well as Object of all divine Knowledge, Faith and Worship,
who only doth enlighten the Minds, and persuade and convince the
Understandings of People, I do hereby grant and declare, That no Person
or Persons, inhabiting in this Province or Territories, who shall
confess and acknowledge <i>One</i> Almighty God, the Creator, Upholder and
Ruler of the World; and profess him or themselves obliged to live
quietly under the civil Government, shall be in any Case molested or
prejudiced, in his or their Person or Estate, because of his or their
conscientious Persuasion or Practice, nor be compelled to frequent or
maintain any religious Worship, Place or Ministry, contrary to his or
their Mind, or to do or suffer any other Act or Thing, contrary to their
religious Persuasion.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">AND</span> that all Persons who also profess to believe in <i>Jesus Christ</i>, the
Saviour of the World, shall be capable (notwithstanding their other
Persuasions and Practices in Point of Conscience and Religion) to serve
this Government in any Capacity, both legislatively and executively, he
or they solemnly promising, when lawfully required, Allegiance to the
King as Sovereign, and Fidelity to the Proprietary and Governor, and
taking the Attests as now established by the Law made at <i>Newcastle</i> in
the Year <i>one Thousand and seven Hundred</i>, entitled, <i>An Act directing
the Attests of several Officers and Ministers, as now amended and
confirmed by this present Assembly</i>.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p><span class="gesperrt">FOR</span> the well governing of this Province and Territories, there shall be
an Assembly yearly chosen, by the Freemen thereof, to consist of <i>four</i>
Persons out of each County, of most Note for Virtue, Wisdom and Ability,
(or of a greater Number at any Time, as the Governor and Assembly shall
agree) upon the <i>first</i> Day of <i>October</i> for ever; and shall sit on the
<i>fourteenth</i> Day of the same Month, at <i>Philadelphia</i>, unless the
Governor and Council for the Time being, shall see Cause to appoint
another Place within the said Province or Territories: Which Assembly
shall have Power to chuse a Speaker and their other Officers; and shall
be Judges of the Qualifications and Elections of their own Members; sit
upon their own Adjournments; appoint Committees; prepare Bills in order
to pass into Laws; impeach Criminals, and redress Grievances; and shall
have all other Powers and Privileges of an Assembly, according to the
Rights of the free-born Subjects of <i>England</i>, and as is usual in any of
the King's Plantations in <i>America</i>.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">AND</span> if any County or Counties, shall refuse or neglect to chuse their
respective Representatives as aforesaid, or if chosen, do not meet to
serve in Assembly, those who are so chosen and met, shall have the full
Power of an Assembly, in as ample Manner as if all the Representatives
had been chosen and met, provided they are not less than <i>two Thirds</i> of
the whole Number that ought to meet.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">AND</span> that the Qualifications of Electors and Elected, and all other
Matters and Things relating to Elections of Representatives to serve in
Assemblies, though not herein particularly expressed, shall be and
remain as by a Law of this Government, made at <i>New-Castle</i> in the Year
<i>one Thousand seven Hundred</i>, entitled, <i>An Act to ascertain the Number
of Members of Assembly, and to regulate the Elections</i>.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p><span class="gesperrt">THAT</span> the Freemen in each respective County, at the Time and Place of
meeting for electing their Representatives to serve in Assembly, may as
often as there shall be Occasion, chuse a double Number of Persons to
present to the Governor for Sheriffs and Coroners, to serve for <i>three</i>
Years, if so long they behave themselves well; out of which respective
Elections and Presentments, the Governor shall nominate and
commissionate one for each of the said Offices, the <i>third</i> Day after
such Presentment, or else the <i>first</i> named in such Presentment, for
each Office as aforesaid, shall stand and serve in that Office for the
Time before respectively limited; and in Case of Death or Default, such
Vacancies shall be supplied by the Governor, to serve to the End of the
said Term.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">PROVIDED ALWAYS</span>, That if the said Freemen, shall at any Time neglect or
decline to chuse a Person or Persons for either or both the aforesaid
Offices, then and in such Case, the Persons that are or shall be in the
respective Offices of Sheriffs or Coroners, at the Time of Election,
shall remain therein, until they shall be removed by another Election as
aforesaid.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">AND</span> that the Justices of the respective Counties, shall or may nominate
and present to the Governor <i>three</i> Persons, to serve for Clerk of the
Peace for the said County, when there is a Vacancy, one of which the
Governor shall commissionate, within <i>ten</i> Days after such Presentment,
or else the <i>first</i> nominated, shall serve in the said Office during
good Behaviour.</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p><span class="gesperrt">THAT</span> the Laws of this Government shall be in this Stile, viz. <i>By the
Governor, with the Consent and Approbation of the Freemen in General
Assembly met</i>; and shall be, after Confirmation by the Governor,
forthwith recorded in the Rolls-office, and kept at <i>Philadelphia</i>,
unless the Governor and Assembly shall agree to appoint another Place.</p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p><span class="gesperrt">THAT</span> all Criminals shall have the same Privileges of Witnesses and
Council as their Prosecutors.</p>


<h4>VI.</h4>

<p><span class="gesperrt">THAT</span> no Person or Persons shall or may, at any Time hereafter, be
obliged to answer any Complaint, Matter or Thing whatsoever, relating to
Property, before the Governor and Council, or in any other Place, but in
ordinary Course of Justice, unless Appeals thereunto shall be hereafter
by Law appointed.</p>


<h4>VII.</h4>

<p><span class="gesperrt">THAT</span> no Person within this Government, shall be licensed by the Governor
to keep an Ordinary, Tavern, or House of publick Entertainment, but such
who are first recommended to him, under the Hands of the Justices of the
respective Counties, signed in open Court; which Justices are and shall
be hereby impowered, to suppress and forbid any Person, keeping such
Publick-house as aforesaid, upon their Misbehaviour, on such Penalties
as the Law doth or shall direct; and to recommend others from Time to
Time, as they shall see Occasion.</p>


<h4>VIII.</h4>

<p><span class="gesperrt">IF</span> any Person, through Temptation or Melancholy, shall destroy himself,
his Estate, real and personal, shall notwithstanding descend to his Wife
and Children, or Relations, as if he had died a natural Death; and if
any Person shall be destroyed or killed by Casualty or Accident, there
shall be no Forfeiture to the Governor by Reason thereof.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">AND</span> no Act, Law or Ordinance whatsoever, shall at any Time hereafter, be
made or done, to alter, change or diminish the Form or Effect of this
Charter, or of any Part or Clause therein, contrary to the true Intent
and Meaning thereof, without the Consent of the Governor for the Time
being, and <i>six</i> Parts of <i>seven</i> of the Assembly met.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">BUT</span> because the Happiness of Mankind depends so much upon the enjoying
of Liberty of their Consciences as aforesaid, I do hereby solemnly
declare, promise and grant, for me, my Heirs and Assigns, that the
<i>first</i> Article of this Charter relating to Liberty of Conscience, and
every Part and Clause therein, according to the true Intent and Meaning
thereof, shall be kept and remain without any Alteration, inviolably for
ever.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">AND LASTLY</span>, I the said <i>William Penn</i>, Proprietary and Governor of the
Province of <i>Pensylvania</i>, and Territories thereunto belonging, for
myself, my Heirs and Assigns, have solemnly declared, granted and
confirmed, and do hereby solemnly declare, grant and confirm, That
neither I, my Heirs or Assigns, shall procure or do any Thing or Things,
whereby the Liberties in this Charter contained and expressed, nor any
Part thereof, shall be infringed or broken: And if any Thing shall be
procured or done, by any Person or Persons, contrary to these Presents,
it shall be held of no Force or Effect.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">IN WITNESS</span> whereof, I the said <i>William Penn</i>, at <i>Philadelphia</i> in
<i>Pensylvania</i>, have unto this present Charter of Liberties, set my Hand
and broad Seal, this <i>twenty-eighth</i> Day of <i>October</i>, in the Year of
our Lord, <i>one Thousand seven Hundred and One</i>, being the <i>thirteenth</i>
Year of the Reign of King <i><span class="gesperrt">WILLIAM</span> the Third</i>, over <i>England, Scotland,
France</i>, and <i>Ireland</i>, &amp;c. and the <i>twenty-first</i> Year of my
Government.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">AND NOTWITHSTANDING</span> the Closure and Test of this present Charter as
aforesaid, I think fit to add this following Proviso thereunto, as Part
of the same, <i>That is to say</i>, That notwithstanding any Clause or
Clauses in the above-mentioned Charter, obliging the Province and
Territories, to join together in Legislation, I am content, and do
hereby declare, That if the Representatives of the Province and
Territories shall not hereafter agree to join together in Legislation,
and that the same shall be signified unto me, or my Deputy, in open
Assembly, or otherwise, from under the Hands and Seals of the
Representatives, for the Time being, of the Province and Territories, or
the major Part of either of them, at any Time within <i>three</i> Years from
the Date hereof, that in such Case, the Inhabitants of each of the
<i>three</i> Counties of this Province, shall not have less than <i>eight</i>
Persons to represent them in Assembly, for the Province; and the
Inhabitants of the Town of <i>Philadelphia</i> (when the said Town is
incorporated) <i>two</i> Persons to represent them in Assembly; and the
Inhabitants of each County in the Territories, shall have as many
Persons to represent them, in a distinct Assembly for the Territories,
as shall be by them requested as aforesaid.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">NOTWITHSTANDING</span> which Separation of the Province and Territories, in
Respect of Legislation, I do hereby promise, grant and declare, That the
Inhabitants of both Province and Territories, shall separately enjoy all
other Liberties, Privileges and Benefits, granted jointly to them in
this Charter, any Law, Usage, or Custom of this Government heretofore
made and practised, or any Law made and passed by this General Assembly,

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
